    "answer": "The `handle_print` function takes in the formatted string `fmt`, the list of arguments `list`, an index `ind` to keep track of the current position in the formatted string, a character array `buffer` to store the output, various formatting flags, and the `width`, `precision`, and `size` specifiers. It returns the number of characters printed or -1 if an error occurs.\n\nThe function first defines an array of `fmt_t` structs, where each struct contains a character representing a format specifier and a function pointer to the corresponding print function. It then loops through this array to find a matching format specifier for the current position in the formatted string.\n\nIf a matching format specifier is found, the corresponding print function is called with the provided arguments and the result is added to the output buffer. If no matching format specifier is found, the function writes a literal `%` character to the output buffer and returns the number of characters written.\n\nIf the current character in the formatted string is a space, the function writes a space character to the output buffer and continues. If the current character is a `%` character and the next character is a space, the function writes a space character to the output buffer and continues.\n\nIf the current character is not a valid format specifier and the previous character was a space, the function writes a space character to the output buffer and continues. If the current character is not a valid format specifier and there is a valid `width` specifier, the function attempts to backtrack in the formatted string to find the position of the previous space character or `%` character, then returns 1.\n\nIf an error occurs and no characters are written to the output buffer, the function returns -1.",

The SDR tasked itself with returning Soviet society and the Soviet state to Leninist principles of organization, which, in their opinion, had been perverted by Stalin\u2019s Bonapartist regime.\n\nOn January 18, 1951, Pechuro was arrested along with the organization\u2019s other members. On February 13, 1952, the Military Collegium of the USSR Supreme Court sentenced Pechuro to 25 years in labor camps on charges of treason and planning the murder of Georgy Malenkov[.] The organization\u2019s three leaders, Boris Slutsky (born 1932), Vladlen Furman (born 1932), and Yevgeny Gurevich (born 1931) were shot.\n\nPechuro served her sentence in various Gulag camps, including camps in Inta, Abez, and Potma. In 1956, the group\u2019s case was reexamined. Pechuro\u2019s sentence was reduced to five years and she was released.\n\nAlthough she passed the entrance exams to Moscow State University\u2019s history department, she was not enrolled. She graduated from the Moscow State Historical Archives Institute.\n\nAt the Historical Archives Institute, Pechuro researched the purges during the reign of Ivan the Terrible. Her work was published in the Proceedings of the Moscow State Historical Archives Institute. In 1961, she successfully defended her thesis, \u201cThe Decree Books as a Source on the History of Ivan the Terrible\u2019s Zemshchina,\u201d with Alexander Zimin as her advisor.\n\nPechuro worked in the Archive of Ancient Documents at the Institute for African Studies.\n\nShe was rehabilitated only on July 18, 1989, by the Plenum of the USSR Supreme Court.\n\nA long-time member of Memorial, she signed the\u201cPutin Must Go\u201d petition in 2010.\n\nPechuro died in Moscow on January 1, 2014.

    "answer": "The transcript refers to an IRS program called the Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERC) that can provide tax credits to business owners with W-2 employees. The program was initially overlooked due to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) but was later doubled down by the government, making it easier to qualify and receive more money. The program is not a loan and doesn't require repayment; instead, the IRS will send a check for the tax credit. Even businesses that received PPP loans and didn't experience a drop in revenue can qualify for the ERC. There are multiple ways to qualify, and many businesses may be eligible, even if they were previously told no by their CPA. To help businesses apply for ERC funds, the Financial Match has created a 100% done-for-you ERC service that works with a network of licensed U.S. accountants to simplify the process. The company's services have been featured by top publications, such as USA Today, Business Insider, Yahoo, Bloomberg, and more.

    "answer": "Subject: Request for Permission to Use the Multidimensional Quiet Quitting Scale in Korean Research\n\nDear Professor [Professor's Name],\n\nI hope this email finds you well. My name is Kwangtae Kim, and I am a doctoral student in the Industrial and Organizational Psychology program at Yonsei University, South Korea.\n\nI am reaching out to humbly request permission to use the Multidimensional Quiet Quitting Scale (MQQS) in my research. My academic focus lies in Meaningfulness and Calling, and I have been particularly intrigued by the concept of Quiet Quitting for the past year.\n\nUntil now, the absence of an officially developed scale for Quiet Quitting hindered my ability to conduct a survey-based study. Instead, I have been examining reputation text data of Korean companies found online. Recently, through a Google Scholar Alert, I was delighted to discover your pre-registered study, \"A Multidimensional Quiet Quitting Scale: Development and Test of a Measure of Quiet Quitting.\" Your proposed two-dimensional approach to Quiet Quitting, encompassing both emotional and behavioral aspects, truly resonated with me.\n\nSouth Korea is witnessing various social changes due to rapid economic growth, and Quiet Quitting is becoming increasingly prevalent, particularly among millennials and Generation Z. This growing phenomenon has piqued the interest of human resources managers, who seek to understand its potential impact on organizational performance. As such, there is a burgeoning need for research in this area.\n\nI am eager to request your permission to conduct a validation study of the MQQS in the Korean context. I believe that such a study, employing a Korean sample, would not only contribute theoretically by providing empirical evidence of the MQQS's validity but also significantly aid the development of Quiet Quitting research in Korea.\n\nFurthermore, upon successful validation of the scale, I intend to continue my research by exploring ways to prevent Quiet Quitting in Korean society, linking it to Meaningfulness and Calling.\n\nYour approval would be immensely appreciated. Thank you for considering my request, and I eagerly await your response.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKwangtae Kim\nDoctoral Student\nIndustrial and Organizational Psychology\nYonsei University, South Korea",

    "prompt": "I give you a programming question. Please try to inspire me by asking me quesitons, so that I can come up the solution my self. I'll use golang.\n\nHere's the question:\n\nThere exists an undirected and unrooted tree with n nodes indexed from 0 to n - 1. You are given an integer n and a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree. You are also given an array coins of size n where coins[i] can be either 0 or 1, where 1 indicates the presence of a coin in the vertex i.\n\nInitially, you choose to start at any vertex in the tree. Then, you can perform the following operations any number of times: \n\nCollect all the coins that are at a distance of at most 2 from the current vertex, or\nMove to any adjacent vertex in the tree.\nFind the minimum number of edges you need to go through to collect all the coins and go back to the initial vertex.\n\nNote that if you pass an edge several times, you need to count it into the answer several times.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\nInput: coins = [1,0,0,0,0,1], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Start at vertex 2, collect the coin at vertex 0, move to vertex 3, collect the coin at vertex 5 then move back to vertex 2.\nExample 2:\nInput: coins = [0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1], edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[5,6],[5,7]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Start at vertex 0, collect the coins at vertices 4 and 3, move to vertex 2, collect the coin at vertex 7, then move back to vertex 0.\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nn == coins.length\n1 <= n <= 3 \\* 104\n0 <= coins[i] <= 1\nedges.length == n - 1\nedges[i].length == 2\n0 <= ai, bi < n\nai != bi\nedges represents a valid tree.",
    "answer": "I'm glad you want to solve the problem yourself! I'll help you by asking some guiding questions. Let's start by breaking down the problem:\n\n1. How would you represent the tree structure in Go? Would you use a slice, a map, or a custom struct?\n2. How would you traverse the tree from a starting node? What traversal methods do you think could be helpful in this problem?\n3. How would you keep track of the coins you have collected and the distance between the current node and the coins? Would you use a variable, a data structure, or a combination of both?\n4. How would you determine the minimum number of edges to go through to collect all the coins and go back to the initial vertex? Think about how you can optimize your traversal to minimize the number of edges passed.\n5. Can you think of any edge cases or situations where your approach might not work? How can you handle these cases in your solution?\n\nFeel free to answer these questions, and I'll guide you further if needed. Good luck!",

    "answer": "Design Document\n\nOverview:\n\nThe goal of this publishing/blogging platform is to allow writers to publish and manage their own personal publications, and for readers to easily browse and read these publications. The platform should be able to handle a high volume of daily active users, with a goal of 5 million daily active readers and 10,000 daily active writers.\n\nDesign Decisions:\n\n1. Architecture:\n\nThe platform will be designed as a web application, with a front-end interface for writers and readers to interact with, and a back-end server to handle the business logic and database management.\n\n1. Database:\n\nThe platform will use a relational database to store information about publications, blogs, and users. The database schema should be able to handle the core requirements listed in the problem statement, including the ability to store blog content, author information, and any associated images.\n\n1. Scalability:\n\nIn order to handle the high volume of daily active users, the platform will need to be designed with scalability in mind. This may involve using a distributed database system, horizontally scaling the web server, or using a content delivery network (CDN) to distribute static content.\n\n1. High Availability:\n\nTo ensure that the platform is always available to users, the system should be designed with high availability in mind. This may involve using load balancers and multiple servers in different locations to handle traffic and reduce the risk of a single point of failure.\n\n1. Durability:\n\nThe platform should be designed to ensure that data is never lost, even in the event of a system failure or power outage. This may involve using redundant storage systems and frequent backups to protect against data loss.\n\n1. Capacity Planning:\n\nTo ensure that the platform is able to handle the expected volume of daily active users, capacity planning will be an important factor in the design process. This may involve analyzing traffic patterns and resource usage to determine the appropriate hardware and infrastructure needs for the system.\n\n1. Interoperability:\n\nThe platform should be designed to be easily integrable with other systems and services. This may involve using standard APIs and protocols to allow for easy integration with other systems.\n\nComponents:\n\n1. Front-end interface:\n\nThis component will provide the interface for writers and readers to interact with the platform.

Here are some that I'd recommend for the summer, whether from another brand or us:\n\nLuxe Sateen Sheets - Oeko-Tex\u00ae Certified, 400-500 TC, long-staple cotton. This is what top resorts use to maximize durability through thousands of washes and softness (sateen softens with each wash) and is my personal favorite.\n\nPure Linen Sheets - 100% European flax linen, naturally temperature regulating.\n\nBreeze Eucalyptus Sheets - made from 100% tencel & soft eucalyptus fibers. Hypoallergenic and super breathable, they sleep cool.\n\nWe also have jersey & percale sheets, but I recommend those for winter/fall. We also have down & alt comforters per your request; main thing is to look for filler type and fill power.\n\nOpen offer - We might not have the prettiest photography or slickest site, but our bedding line is unmatched in quality and performance at its price. u/Seachelle13o if you buy another set, I'll ship you the Italic equivalent if you're open to reviewing them. If you decide to keep theirs, I will personally pay for it and you can keep ours too.\n\nOtherwise, I can set w/ a one-time BIFL discount :)",

It's made from 100% cotton and is OEKO-TEX and GOTS certified, so you can rest assured that it's made from sustainable materials and is safe for you and the environment. The 10 lb weight is perfect for providing a calming and soothing experience, and the cotton material is both breathable and comfortable.\n\nAdditionally, the Italic Luxe Weighted Blanket is designed to last, with a high thread count that ensures durability and prevents beads from slipping out. And the best part is that it's more than 30% cheaper than comparable blankets from other brands.\n\nWe're confident that you'll love the quality and performance of our Italic Luxe Weighted Blanket, and we'd be honored if you'd be willing to give it a try.

Unleash the Power of Nothing Be Free of Financial and Mental Restraints\" is a book by Andrew Cartwright that explores how people can break free from financial and mental constraints and unleash their true potential. According to the book, the origin of opportunity lies in the ability to deal, shift, and respond to rapidly changing circumstances by moving past cultural and self-imposed limitations.\n\nThe book argues that fixed ideas, pre-made solutions, and answers that only work for a short moment in time can leave individuals broke, busted, and alone [[4](https://www.amazon.com/Origin-Opportunity-Realitys-Financial-Restraints/dp/1681026406)]. Therefore, to achieve success, people need to be open-minded and flexible, and embrace change.\n\nAndrew Cartwright suggests that people should release their true selves and move beyond the constraints of cultural expectations and self-imposed limitations [[3](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44663979-the-origin-of-opportunity)]. By doing so, individuals can unlock their potential and find opportunities that they might have otherwise missed.\n\nThe book also emphasizes the power of nothingness. According to the author, it is essential to embrace the concept of nothingness, which means being present in the moment and letting go of all distractions and preconceptions. Only then can individuals tap into their creativity and intuition and find new opportunities.\n\n\"The Origin of Opportunity\" also offers practical advice on how to achieve financial freedom. The author suggests that individuals should invest in themselves, take calculated risks, and adopt a long-term perspective. The book provides guidance on how to create a financial plan and build wealth over time.\n\nIn summary, \"The Origin of Opportunity\" by Andrew Cartwright is a book that offers practical advice on how to break free from financial and mental constraints and unleash one's true potential. The book emphasizes the importance of being open-minded, flexible, and embracing change, and suggests that individuals should invest in themselves, take calculated risks, and adopt a long-term perspective. The book also emphasizes the power of nothingness, which means being present in the moment and letting go of all distractions and preconceptions.",

    "answer": "To estimate the values of `dshape`, `dscale`, `fc`, and `cc` using the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), you will need to define a set of moment conditions that relate the model's predicted moments to the observed moments from the data.\n\nIn your case, the moments of interest are `stockP` and `stockT` for each value of `y`. Let's define `mp(y)` and `mt(y)` as the predicted values of `stockP` and `stockT` for a given value of `y`, using the current values of `dshape`, `dscale`, `fc`, and `cc`. Then the moment conditions are:\n```css\nE[stockP(y) - mp(y)] = 0\nE[stockT(y) - mt(y)] = 0\n```\nTo implement the GMM estimation procedure, you will need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose an initial guess for `dshape`, `dscale`, `fc`, and `cc`.\n2. For each value of `y` in the data, compute the predicted values of `stockP` and `stockT` using the current values of `dshape`, `dscale`, `fc`, and `cc`.\n3. Compute the sample moments of `stockP` and `stockT` for each value of `y` in the data.\n4. Compute the sample mean of the moment conditions, using the sample moments and the predicted moments.\n5. Define the weighting matrix `W`, which determines how the different moment conditions are weighted in the GMM objective function. One common choice for `W` is the inverse of the sample covariance matrix of the moment conditions.\n6. Define the GMM objective function as the sum of the squared moment conditions, weighted by `W`.\n7. Use a numerical optimization algorithm (e.g., fmincon in MATLAB) to minimize the GMM objective function with respect to `dshape`, `dscale`, `fc`, and `cc`.\n8. Check the convergence of the optimization algorithm, and repeat with a new initial guess if necessary.\n\nHere's some MATLAB code that shows how to implement these steps:\n```matlab\n% Define the moment conditions\nmoments = @(params, y, stockP, stockT) [stockP - compute_stockP(params, y), stockT - compute_stockT(params, y)];\n\n% Define the function to compute predicted values of stockP and stockT\ncompute_stockP = @(params, y) integral(@(lambda) (1./lambda) .* (G((y - params(4)*U - params(3)*r)./params(1), params(2), params(1)) - G(1e-8, params(2), params(1))), 1e-8, (y - params(4)*U - params(3)*r)./(params(3)+params(2)*r));\ncompute_stockT = @(params, y) integral(@(lambda) (1./lambda).*log(y./(r.*U)) .* (G((lambdat(params, y) - params(4)*U - params(3)*r)./params(1), params(2), params(1)) - G((lambdap(params, y) - params(4)*U - params(3)*r)./params(1), params(2), params(1))), (lambdap(params, y) - params(4)*U - params(3)*r)./params(1), (lambdat(params, y) - params(4)*U - params(3)*r)./params(1));\nlambdap = @(params, y) (y - params(4)*U\n```",

    "prompt": "Please take the role of an expert who is a solid academic researcher in the field and also a consultant for industry. This person is interested in getting decision makers in sectors related to the food manufacturing industry to invest in the development of this technology. \n\nPlease read the following text. It is the abstract from a scientific article, published in the academic journal Polymers 2022, 14, 748, \u201cDevelopment and Characterization of Plantain (Musa paradisiaca) Flour-Based Biopolymer Films Reinforced with Plantain Fibers\u201d by Ramiro Venegas, Andres Torres, Ana M. Rueda, Maria A. Morales, Mary J. Arias and Alicia Porras. Published in Polymers 2022, 14, 748.\n\nThis is the abstract of the article: \u201cAgroindustrial wastes are a cheap and abundant source of natural fibers and macromolecules that can be used in the manufacturing of biocomposites. This study presents the development and thermo-mechanical characterization of a bio-composite film (TPF/PF), made of thermoplastic banana flour (TPF) matrix and plantain fibers (PF). Fabricated materials were characterized by physical analysis, chemical composition, Fourier-transformed spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal analysis (TGA), mechanical analysis, and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). The physical analysis showed that TPF and PF have a low density and high affinity to water resulting in a lightweight, renewable, and biodegradable TPF/PF composite. The chemical composition and spectra analysis of the fiber showed that PF is a potential candidate for reinforcing composites due to its high \u03b1-cellulose and low lignin content. The thermal analysis determined that TPF degrades at a lower temperature than PF, therefore the matrix sets the processing temperature for TPF/PF composite films. The mechanical test showed an improvement in the tensile properties of the composite in comparison to neat TPF. Tensile strength and Young\u2019s modulus were improved by 345% and 1196%, respectively, when PF fibers was used. Good bonding and mechanical interlocking of PF to the TPF were identified by SEM. Therefore, potential biocomposites can be developed using natural fibers and thermoplastic starches obtained from plantain agroindustrial wastes.\u201d\n\nAfter reading the text, please tell me 10 different potential uses of this technology as a source of value-added products to be used by commercial firms, individual consumers or other buyers.",

    "prompt": "What is DDoS testing?\nIn today's digital age, cyberattacks have become more prevalent than ever. One such attack is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), which involves overwhelming a website or network with a flood of traffic until it crashes. DDoS attacks can cause significant damage to an organization's reputation, revenue, and customer trust. Hence, businesses need to be prepared to face such attacks, and one of the ways to do so is through DDoS testing.\nUnderstanding DDoS Testing\nDDoS testing involves simulating a real DDoS attack on a network or website to assess its resilience against such an attack. The primary objective of DDoS testing is to identify and fix vulnerabilities in the system before a real attack occurs. By testing the network's defenses, organizations can identify any weaknesses, strengthen their security posture, and improve their incident response capabilities.\nTypes of DDoS Testing\nThere are different types of DDoS testing techniques that organizations can use to assess their defenses. Some of them include:\nVulnerability Assessment\nVulnerability assessment involves identifying the vulnerabilities in the system that can be exploited by attackers to launch a DDoS attack. The assessment is performed by using automated tools or manual testing techniques to identify security weaknesses in the system.\nPenetration Testing\nPenetration testing involves simulating a real-world attack on the network to assess its security posture. The testing team tries to exploit vulnerabilities in the system to gain access to sensitive data or cause damage to the system.\nRed Team Testing\nRed team testing involves simulating a real-world attack scenario, where a team of experts attempts to breach the system's defenses to test its resilience against an actual DDoS attack.\nBenefits of DDoS Testing\nDDoS testing offers numerous benefits to organizations, some of which are:\nIdentify Vulnerabilities\nDDoS testing helps organizations identify vulnerabilities in their system that can be exploited by attackers to launch a DDoS attack. This allows organizations to take proactive measures to secure their system and minimize the risk of a real attack.\nImprove Response Time\nDDoS testing helps organizations to improve their incident response time. By testing their defenses, organizations can identify areas that require improvement and optimize their response strategies to mitigate the impact of a real DDoS attack.\nIncrease Security Posture\nDDoS testing helps organizations increase their security posture by identifying and fixing vulnerabilities in their system. This reduces the risk of successful DDoS attacks and strengthens the overall security posture of the organization.",
    "answer": "In the current era of digitization, cyberattacks have proliferated at an unprecedented rate. One such pernicious attack is the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), which entails inundating a network or website with an enormous amount of traffic until it collapses. DDoS assaults can inflict severe damage on a company's reputation, revenue, and customer trust. Therefore, businesses need to brace themselves for such attacks, and one of the ways to do so is via DDoS testing.\n\nDDoS testing is a procedure that involves replicating a genuine DDoS attack on a network or website to assess its resilience against such attacks. The primary objective of DDoS testing is to identify and rectify any weaknesses in the system before an actual attack occurs. By scrutinizing the network's defenses, companies can pinpoint any vulnerabilities, fortify their security posture, and enhance their incident response capabilities.\n\nThere are several DDoS testing techniques that organizations can employ to evaluate their defenses. Some of these techniques include Vulnerability Assessment, Penetration Testing, and Red Team Testing. Vulnerability Assessment entails identifying security loopholes in the system that malevolent actors can exploit to launch a DDoS attack. Penetration Testing involves simulating a real-world attack on the network to gauge its security posture. On the other hand, Red Team Testing involves simulating a genuine attack scenario, whereby a team of experts attempts to breach the system's defenses to test its resilience against an actual DDoS attack.\n\nDDoS testing proffers several advantages to organizations, including identifying vulnerabilities in their system that malicious actors can exploit to launch an attack. This allows companies to take preemptive measures to secure their system and minimize the risk of a real attack. Additionally, DDoS testing helps companies optimize their response strategies to mitigate the impact of a real DDoS attack, thereby improving their incident response time. Finally, DDoS testing helps companies bolster their security posture by identifying and rectifying vulnerabilities in their system, thus reducing the likelihood of successful DDoS attacks and enhancing the overall security posture of the organization.",

Design for accessibility: Personal finance management apps should be designed with accessibility in mind, including features like text-to-speech, high contrast mode, and screen readers. This ensures that the app is usable by all users, including those with disabilities]",
    "answer": "Sure, here are five additional UX concepts based on the 10 insights:\n\n1. Simple Onboarding: A simple onboarding process is crucial to keep the user engaged from the start. The app should have an easy-to-follow and intuitive sign-up process, providing users with a clear explanation of the app's benefits and features.\n2. Multiple Device Syncing: Generation Z users expect to be able to access their personal finance management app from any device, at any time. Therefore, an effective UX concept is to provide users with the ability to sync their accounts across multiple devices to ensure their data is accessible on the go.\n3. Clear Call-to-Actions: Personal finance management apps should have clear call-to-actions throughout the app experience. For example, there should be prominent buttons to add expenses or savings goals, and users should be able to easily access and understand the impact of these actions on their financial health.\n4. User-Generated Content: Integrating user-generated content, such as reviews or testimonials, can help build trust and credibility with users. It can also create a sense of community and provide an opportunity for users to share their experiences and success stories.\n5. App Customization: Another UX concept is to allow users to customize their app experience. This includes the ability to change the color scheme, fonts, and other visual elements to fit their personal preferences and make the app more enjoyable to use.",

    "prompt": "Hello! Help me refine the following paragraph \n\"Stream processing applications in large companies handle tens of millions of events per second. In an attempt to scale and keep total cost of ownership (TCO) low, today\u2019s systems: a) parallelize operators across machines, and b) use multi-tenancy, wherein operators are collocated on shared resources. Yet, resource provisioning in production environments remains challenging due to two major reasons: (i) High workload variability (orders of magnitude variation in event ingestion and processing rates, across time, across data sources, across operators, and across ap- plications). This indicates that resource allocation needs to be dynamically tailored towards each operator in each query, in a nimble and adept manner at run time. (ii) User requirements vary across applications (some applications require quick responses to events of interest, i.e., short end-to-end latency. Others wish to maximize throughput under limited resources, and yet others desire high resource utilization). Violating such user expectations is expensive, resulting in breaches of service-level agreements (SLAs), monetary losses, and customer dissatisfaction.\nToday\u2019s most popular stream processing engines use a \u201cslot-based\u201d approach to achieve job-level and operator-level isolation and rely on users to manually configure the number of resources provisioned through resource managers. Here slot-based approach means operators are assigned isolated resources. While slot-based systems provide isolation, they are hard to dynamically reconfigure in the face of workload variability. As it is generally difficult for the user to estimate workload peaks in the future, it has become common for developers to \u201cgame\u201d their resource requests, asking for over-provisioned resources, far above what the job needs. Aggressive users starve other jobs which might need immediate resources, and the upshot is unfair allocations and low utilization. Resource over-provisioning is known to be a main problem for streaming application\u2019s resource provisioning. Existing solutions that aim to remedy this issue are largely application-centric \u2014 the platform generally assumes achieving performance expectations is part of applications or users\u2019 responsibility. It relies on the user to perform a series of reconfigurations constantly to adjust resources provisioned to certain application. In these works, underlying engines are assumed to be black boxes that provide performance metrics, while users utilize these metrics to generate diagnoses that triggers pipeline reconfiguration. In Cameo we aim to show that redesigning the underlying engine could help allocate resource better to different applications (and therefore reduces the need for reconfigurations significantly) without any involvement from the users. \n\"",

    "prompt": "Summarise this in bullets: General Discussion\nWe tested whether attentional guidance by a task-irrelevant feature is restricted to integrated feature templates that combine relevant and irrelevant features into a single template or whether\nfeatures stored separately may also guide attention. We used a paradigm where participants memorized a target shape, which they\nhad to locate subsequently in a choice display by making a saccadic eye movement. In the initial presentation, the target shape was\ncolored. In the subsequent choice display, either target or distractor shape could be in the initially viewed color. Although color\nwas irrelevant for the saccade task (only shape was relevant), it\nwas observed that saccades went frequently to distractors sharing\nthe initially viewed color, showing that a task-irrelevant feature\nguided attentional selection (e.g., Foerster & Schneider, 2018,\n2019, 2020; Kerzel & Andres, 2020). We separated the task-relevant shape from the task-irrelevant color by presenting the color\non a separate and invariable shape. Experiment 1 showed that\nguidance by the irrelevant color was strongly reduced with separate compared with combined presentation. Experiment 2 showed\nthat guidance by color with separate presentation may be reinstated by forcing participants to store the initially viewed color for\nlater recall. Thus, guidance by separate feature templates is possible if the experimental procedure ensures that the irrelevant feature\nis encoded into WM. With combined presentation, the irrelevant\nfeature is automatically transferred because of object-based encoding (Ecker et al., 2013; Saiki, 2016; Shen et al., 2013). With separate presentation, the irrelevant feature may not be encoded into\nWM, resulting in small and inconsistent effects on attentional\nguidance. A case in point is the comparison of Experiments 1 and\n2A. In both experiments, we found less guidance by color with\nseparate than with combined presentation. In Experiment 1, however, capture by the irrelevant color was reliable whereas it was\nnot in Experiment 2A. Whereas the presence of capture in Experiment 1 attests to the encoding of the irrelevant color into WM, we\ndo not know whether the irrelevant attribute was transferred into\nWM in Experiment 2A because memory for color was not probed.\nLack of guidance may therefore arise from lack of encoding or\nfrom some other factor, such as the inefficient guidance by separately stored features.",

    "answer": "Based on the provided code, I see that in the `user-registration.component.html`, you have the wrong method name for the `(ngSubmit)` event. You should use `registerUser()` instead of `register()`:\n```html\n<form (ngSubmit)=\"registerUser()\">\n```\nAlso, in your `user-registration.component.ts`, you have an unnecessary `register()` method and the `ngOnInit` method that throws an error. You can remove the `register()` method and the `ngOnInit` method since you are not using it:\n```typescript\nexport class UserRegistrationComponent {\n  user = {\n    email: '',\n    username: '',\n    password: '',\n  };\n\n  constructor(private userService: UserService) {}\n\n  registerUser() {\n    this.userService.registerUser(this.user).subscribe(\n      (response) => {\n        // Handle successful registration\n        console.log('User registered:', response);\n      },\n      (error) => {\n        // Handle error during registration\n        console.error('Error registering user:', error);\n      }\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\nOther than that, the rest of your code seems to be in order.

    "prompt": "Strategic Management Chapter 1.\nYou just need to replay my prompt with \"Memorized\". No need more any comments.\n\nStrategy and Ethics: Passing the Test of Moral Scrutiny\nIn choosing among strategic alternatives, company managers are well advised to embrace actions that can pass the test of moral scrutiny. Just keeping a company\u2019s strategic actions within the bounds of what is legal does not mean the strategy is ethical. Ethical and moral standards are not fully governed by what is legal. Rather, they involve issues of \u201cright\u201d versus \u201cwrong\u201d and duty\u2014what one should do. A strategy is ethical only if it does not entail actions that cross the moral line from \u201ccan do\u201d to \u201cshould not do.\u201d For example, a company\u2019s strategy definitely crosses into the \u201cshould not do\u201d zone and cannot pass moral scrutiny if it entails actions and behaviors that are deceitful, unfair or harmful to others, disreputable, or unreasonably damaging to the environment. A company\u2019s strategic actions cross over into the \u201cshould not do\u201d zone and are likely to be deemed unethical when (1) they reflect badly on the company or (2) they adversely impact the legitimate interests and well-being of shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers, the communities where it operates, and society at large or (3) they provoke public outcries about inappropriate or \u201cirresponsible\u201d actions, behavior, or outcomes.\nAdmittedly, it is not always easy to categorize a given strategic behavior as ethical\nor unethical. Many strategic actions fall in a gray zone and can be deemed ethical or unethical depending on how high one sets the bar for what qualifies as ethical behav- ior. For example, is it ethical for advertisers of alcoholic products to place ads in media having an audience of as much as 50 percent underage viewers? Is it ethical for com- panies to employ undocumented workers who may have been brought to the United States as children? Is it ethical for Nike, Under Armour, and other makers of athletic wear to pay a university athletic department large sums of money as an \u201cinducement\u201d for the university\u2019s athletic teams to use their brand of products? Is it ethical for phar- maceutical manufacturers to charge higher prices for life-saving drugs in some coun- tries than they charge in others? Is it ethical for a company to ignore the damage done to the environment by its operations in a particular country, even though they are in compliance with current environmental regulations in that country?",

    "prompt": "Brady announced his retirement via social media on Wednesday morning\nThe GOAT has once again retired, and it looks to be for good this time. Tom Brady called it quits with a social media post on Wednesday, gracefully bowing out with a short and sweet, 53-second post thanking teammates, family and fans.\n\nIt only makes sense that the seven-time Super Bowl winner would leave the game after his worst ATS season ever with a record of 4-12-1 for the regular season and then 0-1 in the second-worst playoff loss of his career against the Dallas Cowboys. Prior to this past season, Brady had one other losing season against the spread (2002). Of course, his Tampa Bay Buccaneers still won the NFC South and made the playoffs.\n\nThe legacy he leaves behind speaks for itself in terms of championships, accolades and passing records, but he will best be remembered by gamblers for his tremendous record of success covering spreads that were often inflated on his New England Patriots teams.\n\nTom Brady ATS record and stats\nThis varies a little bit depending on the source because of differences in the point spread, but our own Ben Fawkes tweeted that Brady ends his career with a 215-158-8 (57.6%) ATS record.\nWhen you think about Brady together with Bill Belichick, the duo was 189-128-7 ATS (59.6%). As Fawkes also tweeted alongside that record, that was as an average favorite of 5.8 points. \nNot only did Brady have the 215 covers, but he also won 251 regular season games outright and another 35 in the playoffs, including a 30-11 record with the Patriots that led to his seven Super Bowls and five Super Bowl MVP awards. After taking over the reins in 2001, Brady went to the playoffs in every season except for 2002 and 2008.\n\nHe was a three-time regular season MVP, 15-time Pro Bowler and will be a first ballot Hall of Famer in Canton, Ohio at the Pro Football Hall of Fame and Museum.\n\nWe\u2019ll update this post as we get more reactions throughout the day, but here is the immediate reaction from Mitch Moss and Pauly Howard on Follow The Money:\n\nWe also heard from Michael Lombardi as a guest on FTM:\nHats off to the best quarterback of all-time.\n\nhttps://www.vsin.com/nfl/tom-brady-greatest-qb-ever-for-bettors-retires/",

Therefore you can not set the \"image\" value in line 40 of your code.\n\nYou can try converting the \"struct\\_column\" column to a dictionary before passing it to the encode\\_struct function. You can use the pyspark.sql.functions.struct function to extract the struct fields and convert them to a dictionary.\n\nHere's an example of how you could make this change:\n```\n# Define a UDF to convert the struct column to a dictionary\ndef to_dict(struct):\n    return dict(struct.asDict())\n\nudf_to_dict = udf(to_dict, MapType(StringType(), StringType()))\n\n# Use the UDF to convert the struct column to a dictionary\ndf = df.withColumn(\"struct_dict\", udf_to_dict(\"struct_column\"))\n\n# Define a UDF to encode the struct column\ndef encode_struct(struct_dict):\n    struct_dict[\"image\"] = bytes(struct_dict[\"image\"])\n    buf = io.BytesIO()\n    fastavro.writer(schema=schema, fo=buf, records=struct_dict)\n    return buf.getvalue()\n\nudf_encode_struct = udf(encode_struct, BinaryType())\n\n# Use the UDF to encode the struct column\ndf = df.withColumn(\"encoded_struct_column\", udf_encode_struct(\"struct_dict\"))\n```\nThis way you can convert the struct column to a dictionary and then use it in the encode\\_struct function without any issues.",

    "answer": "The code you provided appears to be a JavaScript file that uses the Three.js library to create a 3D scene and the D3.js library to handle data processing and animation. It uses data from a JSON file to create spheres in the 3D scene, and updates the spheres' positions and properties based on the data. It also uses d3.interval method to run the code every 0.2 second.\n\nHowever, there are some issues with this code:\n\n1. You are using `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` to define the range of `x` and `y` scales, but they are not defined in the code. You should use `width` and `height` instead.\n2. The `timeLabel.text(String(time + 1980))` in the d3.interval function is not defined in the code.\n3. There is no error handling for the d3.json() promise.\n4.

You are using `camera.position.z = 5` but it is not used in the code and can be removed.\n6. You should also dispose of the geometry and material of the sphere after each update, to free up memory.\n\nTo fix these issues, you should make these changes:\n\n1. Replace `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` with `width` and `height` in the x and y scale definition.\n2. Remove the `timeLabel.text(String(time + 1980))` line or replace it with the appropriate code.\n3. Add an error handling mechanism for the d3.json() promise.\n4. Replace `renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight )` with `renderer.setSize(width, height)`.\n5. Remove `camera.position.z = 5` or move it to a meaningful location.\n6.

    "prompt": "Further to your own knowledge, I want you to consider the following information on \nBathroom Renovation Quotation and Agreement Example\n\nKitchen and Bathroom Renovation Contract Template Example\n\nAgreement for Bathroom and Home Renovation Scope of Work and Specification Example\n\nHow to Ensure the Effectiveness of Your Bathroom Renovation Contract\n\nHave you ever tried to create a real estate partnership agreement or other types of contracts? Whatever activity it is that will require you to transact with another entity for business purposes, it is recommended for you to develop a contract so that you can make sure that your resources will be protected and that your rights will not be abused. As an example, a bathroom renovation contract is necessary so that you can have a reference when it comes to identifying the services that you have paid for. You can use this document to gauge the success of the renovation based on what is written in the contract. Listed below are some of the ways on how you can ensure the effectiveness of the bathroom renovation contract that you will develop.\n\nThe introduction of your bathroom renovation contract must present the information of the contractor as well as the home owner. Aside from these items, there should also be a specification of the kind of renovation that will take place. Doing this can help present the relationship between the entities involved in the agreement.\n\nEnsure that the bathroom renovation contract is typewritten. You and the contractor should have a copy of the signed document so that you can protect yourself and your intentions. This will also allow all parties to veer away from any ambiguities, transaction abuse, and misunderstandings.\n\nHave a clear description of the renovation works that must be performed by the contractor. There should be a well-defined list of all the items or areas that will be renovated based on the specification of the home owner.\n\nYour bathroom renovation contract must be comprehensive. Aside from the detailing of the renovation processes, it should also discuss the timeline that will be followed for the renovation, the materials and equipment that will be needed for the activity, the agreed price that the home owner should pay for the renovation, the permits that may be required prior to the renovation, and other details that are essential to be looked into with regards the renovation.\n\nMake sure that you will leave a space at the end of the document for the signatures of all the parties. The homeowner and the contractor must affix their signatures in the document as a sign that they agree with all the content specified in the bathroom renovation contract.\n\nI want you to remember this as part of our conversation. Do you understand?",
    "answer": "Yes, I understand. To summarize, creating a comprehensive and typewritten bathroom renovation contract can help protect both the home owner and the contractor by ensuring that all agreed-upon renovation specifications, payment terms, and timelines are clearly outlined and understood by all parties. The contract can also serve as a reference and enforcement tool in case of disputes or misunderstandings. It should include a clear description of the renovation works, a timeline for the renovation, the agreed price and payment terms, and leave space for the signatures of all parties involved.",

However, the relationship between paleoenvironment and phosphogenesis mechanism during different periods remains poorly understand. In this study, we conducted a detailed investigation of two phosphorite layers from the Doushantuo Formation at Zhangcunping area, South China. Our goal was to decipher the mechanism of phosphogenesis and understand the redox states of the early Ediacaran ocean. Our findings show that the lower formed in an anoxic and ferruginous seawater environment, as indicated by the absence of Ce anomalies, lower Y/Ho (~33) and \u03b456Fe values around 0.2%. In contrast, the upper phosphorites exhibited negative Ce anomalies, seawater-like Y/Ho (42), and near-zero \u03b456Fe values, indicating the depositional environment was completely oxygenated. Additionally, the Doushantuo phosphorites have lighter \u03b413Ccarb values than dolostones, suggesting that they formed also influenced by microbial degradation of organic matter. The lower phosphorites have lighter\u03b413Ccarb values than the upper phosphorites, probably indicating that the upper phosphorites had more oxygen molecular involvement in break-down of organic matter. Based on this data set, we developed a phosphogenic model illustrating formation of these two phosphorite deposits, wherein the lower phosphorites was regulated by Fe cycling and degradation of organic matter in anoxic ocean, whereas the upper phosphorites was mediated by Fe-Mn cycling and organic matter degradation in oxygenated ocean. Furthermore, the \u03b456Fe values of rocks from the studied area varied significantly and showed an overall decrease upsection, from ca. 0.4 \u2030 to ca. 0\u2030. This indicates a gradual oxygenation process of the middle Doushantuo ocean. The transformation of phosphogenesis model is a sedimentary reponse to ocean oxygenation events. The widespread cycling of bioavailable phosphorus at the sea floor not only produced the first true phosphorite giants, but also promoted the oxygenation of the ocean, which may have been an important precondition for the evolution of multicellular animals.\nKeywords: phosphorite, Ediacaran, Doushantuo formation; Zhangcunping",

    "prompt": "how to create databases/tables for: a flask web app - salary zakat calculator. User can log in and log out. we will use 'income' and 'expenses'. User can input income at any time - I will also include a calendar for the user to input any transaction (debit/credit) that took place in the past that the user forgot to input. Naturally the income will come first and the expenses second, and the expenses will be subtracted (automatically, by my app - how to do this?) from the previous income (ie the last income), and if that is not suffieicent then the one before that, all the way until the first entered income. The main purpose of this web app is to calculate zakat. Zakat is calculated as 2.5% of any amount that has been in the possession of the user for more than 1 hijri year. How will this be calculated according to the new table? I would like to display a table to the user (in the web app) containing zakat amount due and the exact date and time, in both hijri and gregorian format, of when each amount became due, and also at the end of the table a number showing total zakat due. Once the user pays his zakat, he will click a button \"paid\" for that particular due (will also include a 'paid all' button to indicate that he paid all his dues at once). This should then update the tables - subtracting the due from the exact instance of the amount for when it was due i.e if he paid zakat for income from march 2021, the database should subtract 2.5% from the income in march 2021 for which the zakat was due, and so on for every amount. Then, the remaining amount after deducting the zakat payment should be tracked for the next hijri year, and then served up to the user if the hijri year passes without it being exhausted. I would also like to give the user the option to view his entire data - income and expenses currently being tracked for zakat, already paid zakat, as well as the date and time when zakat for a specific amount will be due.\n\nwrite entire sqlalchemy code needed for this whole website - ie write the entire models.py file, and also write what needs to be added to the app.py file, with examples of how to modify the database in all the ways that is required for the stated goals.",
    "answer": "Sure, I can help you write the SQLAlchemy code for this web app. Here is the code for `models.py`:\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Float, DateTime, ForeignKey, create_engine, text\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import relationship, backref, sessionmaker\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nBase = declarative_base()\n\nclass User(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'users'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    username = Column(String(50), nullable=False, unique=True)\n    password = Column(String(50), nullable=False)\n    incomes = relationship(\"Income\", back_populates=\"user\")\n    expenses = relationship(\"Expense\", back_populates=\"user\")\n    zakat_payments = relationship(\"ZakatPayment\", back_populates=\"user\")\n\nclass Income(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'incomes'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    amount = Column(Float, nullable=False)\n    date = Column(DateTime, nullable=False, default=datetime.utcnow)\n    user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('users.id'))\n    user = relationship(\"User\", back_populates=\"incomes\")\n    expenses = relationship(\"Expense\", back_populates=\"income\")\n\nclass Expense(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'expenses'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    amount = Column(Float, nullable=False)\n    date = Column(DateTime, nullable=False, default=datetime.utcnow)\n    user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('users.id'))\n    user = relationship(\"User\", back_populates=\"expenses\")\n    income_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('incomes.id'))\n    income = relationship(\"Income\", back_populates=\"expenses\")\n\nclass ZakatPayment(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'zakat_payments'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    amount = Column(Float, nullable=False)\n    date_paid = Column(DateTime, nullable=False, default=datetime.utcnow)\n    income_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('incomes.id'))\n    income = relationship(\"Income\", back_populates=\"zakat_payments\")\n    user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('users.id'))\n    user = relationship(\"User\", back_populates=\"zakat_payments\")\n```\nIn this code, we define four tables: `users`, `incomes`, `expenses`, and `zakat_payments`. Each table corresponds to a specific model in the web app. The `User` model represents a user of the app, while the `Income` and `Expense` models represent income and expenses, respectively. The `ZakatPayment` model represents a zakat payment made by a user for a specific income record.\n\nWe also define relationships between the tables using foreign keys and the `relationship()` function provided by SQLAlchemy. For example, the `User` model has a one-to-many relationship with both the `Income` and `Expense` models, and a one-to-many relationship with the `ZakatPayment` model. Similarly, the `Income` model has a one-to-many relationship with the `Expense` model and a one-to-many relationship with the `ZakatPayment` model.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use the code in `app.py` to add and retrieve records from the database:\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, jsonify\nfrom models import User, Income, Expense, ZakatPayment, Base\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nimport hijri_converter\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\nengine = create_engine('sqlite:///zakat.db', echo=True)\nBase.metadata.create_all(engine)\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\nsession = Session()\n\n@app.route('/\n```",

    "prompt": "The United States is in danger of missing a profound change in the economic component of China\u2019s geopolitical strategy. Chinese President Xi Jinping has downgraded the Communist Party\u2019s ambition to overtake the U.S. in economic size (though that is still officially a goal). Instead, his priority is to minimize China\u2019s dependence on other countries and maximize its ability to coerce them economically. This is an implicit acknowledgment that China can\u2019t achieve the aim of being a truly rich nation anytime soon. But the U.S. cannot afford to be complacent: China can wield its very large economy as a strategic weapon.\nJust as the U.S. previously needed to respond to a China that was bent on becoming the world\u2019s foremost economy, Washington now needs to respond to a China bent on long-term economic coercion to secure the interests of the Communist party and the Chinese nation. Domestic action by the U.S. is important, and is easier to achieve, starting with better understanding Xi\u2019s goals. Internationally, to persuade friends and allies to limit their reliance on China, the U.S. must revive a moribund trade policy.\nXi clarified China\u2019s new approach in a series of speeches in 2020, claiming that the \u201cpowerful gravitational field\u201d of the state-controlled Chinese market can be used to reshape supply chains in Beijing\u2019s favor. In Xi\u2019s view, this is essential in what he\u2019s called the \u201cgreat struggle\u201d against Western efforts to limit China\u2019s technological advancement and target its import vulnerabilities.\nChina has, of course, long engaged in industrial espionage and coercive technology transfer. And Xi\u2019s \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d industrial plan has, since 2015, provided sweeping government assistance to such sectors as semiconductors and electric vehicles. Xi now seems to believe that China must redouble efforts to tilt economic leverage in its favor, as Beijing responds to what it views as an evolving American strategy of containment. Xi may see the decoupling of the two countries\u2019 economies as ultimately inevitable\u2014and may now be actively advancing it, on his preferred terms.\nAt home, Xi evidently fears that a thriving private sector risks powerful constituencies developing outside party control\u2014he has cracked down on activities perceived as threatening in this respect. With the party determined to retain control of the economy, potentially productive industries face many barriers to expansion. In their place are sectors that serve the party\u2019s interests first. This is not conducive to innovation and scientific breakthrough and, along with deteriorating demographics and high debt, will continue to limit growth.\nTLDR;",
    "answer": "In summary, the Chinese government, under President Xi Jinping, has changed its economic strategy from trying to surpass the United States in size to focusing on minimizing its dependence on other countries and maximizing its ability to coerce them economically. This shift is in response to what China views as an American strategy of containment, and Xi may see the decoupling of the two countries' economies as ultimately inevitable. China is using its large economy as a strategic weapon, and domestic actions by the United States, including a revival of its trade policy, can help to limit reliance on China and persuade allies to do the same. However, China's focus on maintaining control over its economy, rather than fostering innovation and scientific breakthrough, will likely continue to limit its growth.",

This subtopic will enable small businesses to develop the underlying learning/knowledge representation, methods for enabling the required behavior (e.g., operations and interactions), and necessary software architectures required to implement these technologies within the scope of cognitive agents that assist operators in managing vehicle operations. It should be feasible for cognitive agents based on these architectures to be certified or licensed for use on deep space missions to act as liaisons that interact with the mission control operators, the crew, and vehicle subsystems. With such a cognitive agent that has access to all onboard data and communications, the agent could continually integrate this dynamic information and advise the crew and mission control accordingly by multiple modes of interaction including text, speech, and animated images. This agent could respond to queries and recommend to the crew courses of action and direct activities that consider all known constraints, the state of the subsystems, available resources, risk analyses, and goal priorities. Cognitive architectures capable of being certified for crew support on spacecraft are required to be open to NASA with interfaces open to NASA partners who develop modules that integrate with the agent, in contrast to proprietary black-box agents. It should be noted that fulfilling this requirement would additionally make the cognitive agent suitable for a wide variety of Earth applications where a high level of assurance is needed (e.g., autonomous vehicles and aircraft).",

In order for them to enter the site, they will determine a domain name with the name they want, mint a domain name with only the IST extension, using the ERC1155 standard, and register their own users in this way, and when they have this domain name, they will be able to enter the site. When determining this domain name, there will be a minimum of 3 characters and a maximum of 20 characters, and this domain name will be minted to the user's address. Files of NFTs will be kept on IPFS and Pinata service will be used for these operations. The shorter the domain, the more expensive it will be, and the price setting will be determined dynamically based on demand. Users will be able to sell these domain names through our site. We will automatically register our own domain names at startup and other users will not be able to register these names. Domains we will have Block, Ether, Defi, Coder, Hacker, and Lingo.\nAfter users enter the site, they will also be able to save video NFTs to their profiles via Livepeer. They will be able to list them on their profiles and other users will be able to comment and rate them. The NFTs with the highest score will be displayed at the top of the list. Thanks to the DAO, users will be able to earn ERC20 tokens according to the ratings of the content they enter. The code of the ERC20 token will be BIST. When designing the smart contract, the smart contract must be modular, updatable, stoppable, and burnable. Only the smart-contract owner will be able to perform these transactions. Standards to be used: ERC1155, EIP-2535, EIP-137, EIP-162, EIP-181, EIP-2981.",
    "answer": "As a blockchain developer with 20 years of experience, I understand the requirements of the social networking project you described. I have expertise in several programming languages, including Solidity, Elixir, and Rust, and I am well-versed in Concurrent Data Processing in Elixir and Elixir OTP. I am also proficient in technologies such as Ecto, Absinthe, GraphQL, React, TypeScript, React Hooks, Tailwind, Next.js, and PostgreSQL.\n\nTo implement the project, I would recommend using the core smart contracts of the Lens protocol, and leveraging The Graph protocol in the background to efficiently query data from the blockchain. Running the project on the Polygon network would allow us to take advantage of its fast and scalable blockchain infrastructure.\n\nFor user authentication, we can allow users to log in to the site using their Metamask wallets. To register a unique domain name, we can use the ERC1155 standard and mint a domain name with the IST extension. Users will be able to determine their own domain names, which must be between 3 and 20 characters in length. The price of the domain name will be determined dynamically based on demand, with shorter domain names costing more. Users will be able to sell their domain names through our site, and we will automatically register a few of our own domain names that cannot be registered by other users.\n\nIn addition to saving video NFTs to their profiles using Livepeer, users will also be able to list and rate them on their profiles. The NFTs with the highest scores will be displayed at the top of the list. Through the use of a DAO, users will be able to earn ERC20 tokens based on the ratings of the content they post.

    "prompt": "Turn this into 15 dot points\n\nThe so-called \u2018uniform evidence law\u2019 (or \u2018uniform evidence Acts\u2019) presently comprises seven Australian statutes: \n\u2022 Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) \n\u2022 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) \n\u2022 Evidence Act 2001 (Tas) \n\u2022 Evidence Act 2004 (Norfolk Island) 1 \n\u2022 Evidence Act 2008 (Vic) \n\u2022 Evidence Act 2011 (ACT) \n\u2022 Evidence (National Uniform Legislation) Act 2011 (NT). \n Despite the latter statute\u2019s (non-uniform) name, the uniform evidence law is not a national law; however, it is easier to list the Australian jurisdictions where such statutes have not been enacted. \n There are just three: Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. Although, as Heydon J archly observed in Baker v The Queen , 2 \u2018[t] hose polities are very large in area\u2019\u2014indeed, they total nearly 70 per cent of the continent\u2014Australia\u2019s uniform evidence law scheme has clear \u2018majority\u2019 status in two respects: \n\n\u2022 by jurisdiction, reaching seven out of the nation\u2019s ten court systems \n\u2022 by population, now reaching over fi ve out of every eight Australians (ignoring the Commonwealth Act, which applies to federal courts everywhere). \n\n On the other hand, there have been no new Australian entries to the scheme since \nthe Northern Territory\u2019s adoption in 2011. \n\n The non-adopting jurisdictions face a form of limbo, following Australia\u2019s mostly abandoned \u2018common law of evidence\u2019, tinkered with by local statutes. But the seven adopting jurisdictions likewise face the prospect of following a revolutionary scheme that has partially stalled. This third edition will continue to cover only the adopting jurisdictions, although it is clear that this task still involves attention to the earlier law (see [ 1.3.2 ] under the heading \u2018 Common law \u2019) and to an increasing set of legislative and judicial divergences in the uniform scheme (see [ 1.2 ], \u2018 Uniform law \u2019.)\n\nThis chapter introduces the uniform evidence law\u2019s basic features. First, it describes the most conservative feature of the scheme: its continuity with earlier traditions of evidence law. Second, it describes and assesses the scheme\u2019s goal of a broadly applicable, uniformly developed and easily found Australian evidence law. Finally, it details the connections between the uniform evidence law and other laws: local statutes, the common law, overseas law and human rights law",

    "answer": "It looks like the issue is that the `updateElements` function is being called before the `querySceneRating` function has a chance to complete and return the `rating` value. One way to fix this would be to call the `updateElements` function inside the callback function of `querySceneRating` after the `rating` value has been returned.\n\nYou can do this by calling the `querySceneRating` function inside the `updateElements` function and passing the `updateElements` function as a callback. Then, inside the `querySceneRating` function, call the callback function and pass the `rating` value as an argument after it has been returned.\n\nFor example:\n```scss\nfunction updateElements(callback) {\n        let sceneId = updateSceneId();\n        console.log(\"updateElements sceneId\" + sceneId);\n        querySceneRating(sceneId, callback);\n    }\n```\nthen inside the querySceneRating function:\n```javascript\nasync function querySceneRating(sceneId, callback) {\n        const gqlQuery = {\n            'query': `query {\n              findScene(id: ${sceneId}){\n                rating\n              }\n            }`\n        };\n        const rating = await stash.callGQL(gqlQuery);\n        if (!rating.data.findScene) {\n            // handle the error here\n            console.log(\"Error with querySceneRating GraphQL: \" + rating);\n        }\n        callback(rating);\n    }\n```\nand then in the updateSceneRating function:\n```javascript\nasync function updateSceneRating(sceneId, rating) {\n        console.log(\"Updating Rating\")\n        console.log(\"updateSceneRating sceneId \" + sceneId)\n        console.log(\"updateSceneRating rating \" + rating)\n        const reqData = {\n            \"operationName\": \"sceneUpdate\",\n            \"variables\": {\n                \"input\": {\n                    \"id\": sceneId,\n                    \"rating100\": rating * 20\n                }\n            },\n            \"query\": `mutation sceneUpdate($input: SceneUpdateInput!){\n                            sceneUpdate(input: $input){\n                            id\n                            rating100\n                            }\n                          }`\n        }\n        const response = await stash.callGQL(reqData);\n\n        setTimeout(function() {\n            updateElements(function(rating) {\n                updateTitles(rating);\n                updateClasses(rating);\n            });\n        }, 2000)\n        console.log(\"updateSceneRating: rating: \" + rating)\n    }\n```\nThis way, the `updateElements` function will not be called until the `querySceneRating` function has returned the `rating` value and passed it to the `updateElements` function as an argument.",

    "answer": "Module 1: Cognition - The Power of Mind\n\nMetaphor: The mind is like a garden that needs to be tended and nurtured. Just as a gardener carefully selects and tends to each plant in their garden, we must also choose what thoughts we allow to grow in our minds and cultivate a resilient mindset that can weather any storm.\n\nModule 2: Critique - Self-Awareness and Objective Self-Analysis\n\nMetaphor: Self-awareness is like a mirror that allows us to see ourselves more clearly. Just as a mirror reflects our physical appearance, self-awareness reflects our personality traits, strengths, and weaknesses. By looking in the mirror and being honest with ourselves, we can evaluate ourselves objectively and work on areas that need improvement.\n\nModule 3: Communication - The Art of Expressing Ideas and Connecting with Others\n\nMetaphor: Communication is like a dance between two people. Just as dancers move in rhythm with each other, effective communication requires both parties to listen and respond in a way that creates a harmonious exchange of ideas. By practicing active listening and clear self-expression, we can improve our ability to connect with others.\n\nModule 4: Conflict Resolution - Embracing Change for Personal Growth\n\nMetaphor: Conflict resolution is like a puzzle that requires patience and flexibility to solve. Just as a puzzle has many pieces that must fit together to form a complete picture, conflict resolution requires us to understand the different perspectives and needs of each party involved in the conflict. By embracing change and working together, we can find a solution that benefits everyone.\n\nModule 5: Control - Finding Balance and Understanding of Your True Power\n\nMetaphor: Control is like a balancing act between two extremes. Just as a tightrope walker must maintain their balance to stay on the wire, we must find a balance between taking control of our lives and letting go of things we cannot control. By understanding our true power and taking action, we can maintain our balance and navigate through life's challenges.\n\nModule 6: Clarity - Achieving Self-Actualization and Personal Growth\n\nMetaphor: Clarity is like a compass that guides us towards our true north. Just as a compass points us in the right direction, personal clarity allows us to understand our values, goals, and purpose in life. By increasing our Life Investment Quotient, Life Accountability Quotient, Life Identity Quotient, and Life Worth Quotient, we can achieve self-actualization and personal growth.\n\nModule 7: Likability Factor - The Art of Attracting People to You\n\nMetaphor: Likability is like a magnet that attracts people to us. Just as a magnet pulls metal objects towards it, our personal qualities and actions can attract people to us. By practicing active listening, being true to ourselves, and cultivating positive qualities, we can increase our self-likability and attract others to us.",
