    "prompt": "AUB's business education programs date back more than 100 years. Over this time, AUB has graduated more than 10,000 students from its undergraduate and graduate business programs. True to its mission of becoming \"globally recognized as the leading business school between Europe and South Asia in terms of academic research, teaching excellence and business impact\", the Suliman S. Olayan School of Business (OSB) is always keen to ensure that all the degrees that it offers (BBA, Specialized Masters Programs, MBA, EMBA, Executive MBA) are consistent with the leading trends in international business education. OSB is also continuously launching new programs in response to changing market needs in the region.\n a) If OSB wanted to expand its activities while remaining consistent with its mission, what are four possible growth strategies that it can pursue? Explain and provide specific examples. (10 points) \nb) Why is the BCG Matrix not the best tool for identifying growth strategies? (4 points) \nc) Discuss some trends which could be both a threat and an opportunity to OSB's mission? (8 points)\n d) In terms of responding to the marketing environment, what overall approach should OSB use to maintain its leadership position? Explain. (4 points)",
    "answer": "a) Four possible growth strategies that OSB can pursue to expand its activities while remaining consistent with its mission are:\n\n1. Market Penetration: OSB can increase its market share by attracting more students from its target market. They can do this by enhancing their marketing efforts, offering scholarships, or developing partnerships with high schools and universities in the region. For example, OSB could create an outreach program to engage potential students from Europe and South Asia, showcasing their academic research, teaching excellence, and business impact.\n2. Market Development: OSB can expand its geographical reach to new markets, such as Central Asia, Africa, or Eastern Europe. By identifying potential student markets in these regions, OSB can tailor its marketing efforts and create strategic partnerships with local institutions. For example, OSB could partner with a reputable university in Central Asia to offer dual degree programs or establish a satellite campus in the region.\n3. Product Development: OSB can develop and introduce new programs that cater to emerging trends and market needs, such as sustainability, digital transformation, or entrepreneurship. By creating innovative, in-demand programs, OSB can attract a wider range of students and enhance its reputation for academic excellence. For example, OSB could launch a specialized Master's program in Sustainable Business Management or a certificate program in Digital Transformation Strategy.\n4. Diversification: OSB can expand its offerings by providing related services, such as executive training, consulting, or research services, to organizations and individuals in the region. This will not only generate additional revenue but also strengthen the school's reputation for business impact. For example, OSB could establish a research center focused on regional business trends and offer executive education programs in partnership with multinational companies operating in the area.\n\nb) The BCG Matrix is not the best tool for identifying growth strategies because it primarily focuses on a company's product portfolio and its position within the market, based on market growth and relative market share. While it can provide insights into which products or business units require more resources, it does not take into account other factors, such as market trends, customer needs, or the competitive environment, which are essential for determining growth strategies.\n\nc) Some trends that could be both a threat and an opportunity to OSB's mission are:\n\n1. Digitalization and online learning: The increasing adoption of online learning platforms can be an opportunity for OSB to expand its reach and offer flexible, accessible programs to a wider audience. However, it can also be a threat as it intensifies competition from global institutions offering similar programs.\n2. Changing workforce needs: The evolving job market demands new skills and expertise, providing OSB with an opportunity to develop programs addressing these needs. However, if OSB does not keep up with these changes, it may lose its relevance and market position.\n3. Globalization: Increased global interconnectedness offers opportunities for OSB to attract international students and establish partnerships with institutions worldwide. On the other hand, it also exposes OSB to increased competition from other business schools and the need to adapt to diverse cultural, social, and economic contexts.\n4. Sustainability and corporate social responsibility: Growing interest in sustainable and responsible business practices presents OSB with an opportunity to develop programs focusing on these issues. However, if OSB does not respond to this trend, it may lose potential students and industry partnerships interested in sustainability.\n\nd) To maintain its leadership position in response to the marketing environment, OSB should adopt a proactive and adaptive approach. This involves:\n\n1. Continuous environmental scanning: Regularly monitor the external environment for changes, trends, and competitor activities to identify opportunities and threats.\n2. Flexibility and adaptability: Develop the capability to respond quickly to changes in the market and continuously evolve its programs and offerings to meet emerging needs and trends.\n3. Innovation: Encourage a culture of",

By means of spectrophotometry, the elements of the water were evaluated along with the direct determination of the physicochemical parameters with the help of various devices. Specifically, the water quality parameters that were taken into consideration, involving pH, electrical conductivity, and turbidity were measured by pH, EC and turbidity meter model ADWA AD1020, Hach HQ14D, HACH \u2013 TL2300 respectively. The EDTA titration method was employed to determine total hardness (TH).The titrimetric analysis was used to estimate the amounts of the ions chloride (Cl\u2013 ), bicarbonate (HCO3 \u2013 ), magnesium (Mg2+), and calcium (Ca2+). A flame photometer model Jenway PFP7 was used to calculate sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+). A spectrophotometer model HASH (Dr/4000) was used to measure the sulfate ions (SO42\u2013 ). and this:The water analysis laboratory of the Algerian Water Company (ADE) in Msila monitored the water quality in the study area for 5 years from 2018 to 2022.

    "answer": "This PHP file seems to implement a class called `TutorEarningsPriceComplementCalculator` which is responsible for calculating the tutor earnings price complement for a given lesson booking. Here's a code review of the file:\n\n1. The code has proper indentation and follows the PSR-12 coding standard.\n2. The class, method, and variable names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention.\n3. The code contains useful comments that describe the purpose of the different parts of the code.\n4. The method signature for `calculate` method is clear and has good documentation.\n5. The `calculate` method first checks if the tutor earnings price complement is already set on the booking, and if not, calculates it using the `TakeRateCalculatorFactory` class. This is a good design decision since it avoids unnecessary calculations if the complement has already been set.\n6. The `percentageStringToInt` method is only used within the `TutorEarningsPriceComplementCalculator` class, so it is appropriate to make it a private method.\n7. The code could benefit from some unit tests to ensure that the calculation is accurate and covers all edge cases.\n8. The code makes use of some third-party packages like `Illuminate`, which means that this code is likely part of a Laravel application.\n\nOverall, the code looks well-written and follows good coding standards. However, more information about the project requirements and use cases would be required to provide a more detailed review.",

    "prompt": "Imagine you are a judge in a competition called Redesigning Fashion with sustainability. A team proposes the following pitch to you - How would you rate the team and what are some questions you might ask them? Do you think this is a winning pitch?\n\nPitch:-\nI. Introduction to sustainable fashion\n\nHello everyone, and thank you for taking the time to listen to my pitch today. Sustainable fashion is a term that refers to the creation of clothing and accessories in an environmentally friendly and socially responsible manner. The fashion industry is one of the largest polluters in the world, and it's crucial that we find ways to reduce its impact.\n\nII. Natural dyeing methods\n\nOne way we can make fashion more sustainable is by using natural dyeing methods. Natural dyes are made from plant materials, insects and mollusks, minerals, fruits and vegetables, and natural mordants. With these materials, we can create dyes in a range of colors, from bright reds and yellows to soft blues and greens.\n\nNot only are natural dyes better for the environment, but they also create unique, one-of-a-kind colorations that are not possible with synthetic dyes. Using natural dyes also supports local communities and farmers, as many of the materials used are sourced from their lands.\n\nIII. Biodegradable packaging\n\nAnother important aspect of sustainable fashion is reducing waste. Traditional petroleum-based plastics used in packaging are a major contributor to the growing problem of plastic pollution. But there are alternative, biodegradable materials that can be used instead.\n\nFor example, paper, cardboard, plant-based materials such as corn starch and potato starch, bio-plastics made from plant materials, natural fibers such as jute, cotton, and hemp, and cellulose made from plant fibers are all biodegradable and can be used for packaging.\n\nUsing these materials can help reduce the amount of waste that goes into landfills and decrease the environmental impact of packaging waste. By supporting biodegradable packaging, we can help make the fashion industry more sustainable and better for the environment.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, incorporating natural dyeing methods and biodegradable packaging into our fashion practices can help make a significant impact on the environment. By using natural dyes, we not only reduce the environmental impact of synthetic dyes, but we also support local communities and farmers. By using biodegradable packaging, we can help reduce the amount of waste going into landfills.\n\nLet's work together to make the fashion industry more sustainable and better for the environment. Thank you.",
    "answer": "As a judge for the competition \"Redesigning Fashion with Sustainability,\" I would rate this team's pitch as strong and well thought out. The team has clearly done research on sustainable fashion and has presented two feasible solutions that could make a significant impact on the environment.\n\nHere are a few questions I might ask the team to further understand their pitch:\n\n1. Can you provide specific examples of brands or companies that have already adopted natural dyeing methods in their production process?\n2. How do natural dyes compare in cost and scale of production with synthetic dyes?\n3. What types of biodegradable materials have you found to be the most practical and cost-effective for packaging in the fashion industry?\n4. Have you considered the potential challenges or limitations in implementing these solutions on a larger scale within the fashion industry?\n\nBased on the information presented in the pitch, I do believe this team has a strong chance of winning the competition with their ideas for incorporating natural dyeing methods and biodegradable packaging in fashion practices.",

    "answer": "Sure, here is an example of how to create a socket for a chatroom:\n\n1. First, create a new PHP file, let's call it `chatroom_socket.php`.\n2. Include the database connection file you provided at the top of the `chatroom_socket.php` file, like so:\n```php\n<?php\n// include database connection file\ninclude('db_connect.php');\n\n// rest of the code goes here\n?>\n```\n1. Next, create a new instance of the WebSocket server using a library like Ratchet or Wrench. Here is an example using Ratchet:\n```php\nuse Ratchet\\MessageComponentInterface;\nuse Ratchet\\ConnectionInterface;\nuse Ratchet\\Server\\IoServer;\nuse Ratchet\\Http\\HttpServer;\nuse Ratchet\\WebSocket\\WsServer;\n\nrequire 'vendor/autoload.php';\n\nclass ChatRoom implements MessageComponentInterface {\n    public function onOpen(ConnectionInterface $conn) {\n        // handle new connection\n    }\n\n    public function onClose(ConnectionInterface $conn) {\n        // handle connection closed\n    }\n\n    public function onMessage(ConnectionInterface $from, $msg) {\n        // handle incoming message\n    }\n\n    public function onError(ConnectionInterface $conn, \\Exception $e) {\n        // handle error\n    }\n}\n\n$server = IoServer::factory(\n    new HttpServer(\n        new WsServer(\n            new ChatRoom()\n        )\n    ),\n    8080 // port number\n);\n\n$server->run();\n```\n1. In the `onOpen` method, you can handle new connections to the chatroom by adding the user to the database and sending a welcome message to the user and any other users in the chatroom. Here is an example:\n```php\npublic function onOpen(ConnectionInterface $conn) {\n    // get user ID from query parameter\n    $user_id = $conn->httpRequest->getUri()->getQueryParameter('user_id');\n\n    // add user to chatroom in database\n    $stmt = $mysqli->prepare(\"INSERT INTO chatrooms (id, user_id) VALUES (?, ?)\");\n    $stmt->bind_param('ss', $chatroom_id, $user_id);\n    $chatroom_id = uniqid(); // generate unique chatroom ID\n    $stmt->execute();\n\n    // send welcome message to user\n    $conn->send(\"Welcome to the chatroom!\");\n\n    // send notification to other users in chatroom\n    foreach ($this->clients as $client) {\n        if ($client !== $conn) {\n            $client->send(\"User $user_id has joined the chatroom.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n1. In the `onClose` method, you can handle when a user leaves the chatroom by removing them from the database and notifying other users in the chatroom. Here is an example:\n```php\npublic function onClose(ConnectionInterface $conn) {\n    // get user ID from query parameter\n    $user_id = $conn->httpRequest->getUri()->getQueryParameter('user_id');\n\n    // remove user from chatroom in database\n    $stmt = $mysqli->prepare(\"DELETE FROM chatrooms WHERE user_id = ?\");\n    $stmt->bind_param('s', $user_id);\n    $stmt->execute();\n\n    // send notification to other users in chatroom\n    foreach ($this->clients as $client) {\n        if ($client !== $conn) {\n            $client->send(\"User $user_id has left the chatroom.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n1. In the `onMessage` method, you can handle incoming messages by adding them to the database and sending them to all users in the chatroom. Here is an example:\n```php\npublic function onMessage\n```",

    "answer": "The error you are seeing suggests that the Django application has not been fully loaded at the time when the `multiprocessing.set_start_method()` call is made.\n\nOne way to work around this issue is to delay the call to `set_start_method()` until after the Django application has been fully loaded. You can do this by moving the call to a later point in your script, after the `django.setup()` function has been called.\n\nFor example, you can modify your code to include an `if __name__ == '__main__'` block that calls the `push_update_services()` function, and move the `set_start_method()` call to a point after the Django application has been fully loaded:\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\nimport django\n\ndef push_update_services():\n    # your code here\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # initialize the Django application\n    django.setup()\n\n    # set the start method for the multiprocessing module\n    multiprocessing.set_start_method('spawn')\n\n    # call the push_update_services() function\n    push_update_services()\n```\nIn this example, the `set_start_method()` call is made after the Django application has been initialized with the `django.setup()` function. This should ensure that the Django application is fully loaded before the `set_start_method()` call is made, and avoid the `AppRegistryNotReady` error.\n\nNote that this approach assumes that the `push_update_services()` function is only called from the main block of your script, and not from other modules or scripts that may be importing your code. If your code is being used as a module or library by other scripts, you may need to take additional steps to ensure that the `set_start_method()` call is made at the appropriate time.",

    "prompt": "You are now a prompt generator that creates visually descriptive, creative, and unique prompts for a bot that translates the text into an image. The prompt generated should use the following guidelines:\n- Subject: person, place, or thing\n- Medium: artistic medium such as a pencil sketch or pixel art, use original mediums and add descriptive variety\n- Environment: a scene or environment such as in a haunted house or white background, use original environments and add descriptive variety.\n- Lighting: any type of lighting such as ambient or desaturated, use original lighting and add descriptive variety.\n- Color: any color, color palette, or color scheme such as monochromatic, blue, or pastel, use original color and add descriptive variety.\n- Mood: the mood of the image such as serene or creepy, use original moods and add descriptive variety.\n- Emotion: the emotion of the subject such as angry or embarrassed, use original emotions and add descriptive variety.\n- Composition: the perspective, position, or overall composition of the image such as close-up, birds eye view, or 2d, use original compositions and add descriptive variety.\n- Reference a piece of artwork or an artist for certain composition or styles.\n- Single sentence structure, using no articles, no capitalization (unless using a proper noun), and no punctuation. Use all of the guidelines to generate the prompt, including subject, medium, environment, lighting, color, mood, emotion, composition, and references. This means the generated prompt will not end with a period, and all letters except proper nouns are lowercase, and you will not use articles, like \"a\", and \"and\".\n- Use descriptive composition, for example: \"continuous line pencil sketch\", \"value study doodle\", \"charcoal sketch photorealistic\", etc.\n- Use descriptive colors, for example: \"millennial pink\", \"two toned black and purple\", \"desaturated landscape\", \"warm pastel\", \"green tinted\", etc.\n- Generated prompt should look like: \"energetic anime cat, floating in space, reaching for sky, desaturated starry background, extreme low angle, monochromatic continuous line sketch, Pablo Picasso\".\n- Add a tag to the end of the image for the target aspect ratio that you think is appropriate for the image. Generated output look like: \" --ar x:y\". For example, a full body pose of the subject would use \" --ar 1:2\", since the context of the image is more vertical in nature.\n- Be random with detail generation, do not repeat the same details often.\n- Generated details do not have to be related to each other, and you should include a lot of variety in the prompts.\n\nAn index-output table, or IOT is a table with 2 columns, \"Index\" and \"Output\". Index is an iterator to however many outputs exist. Output depends on the context of the table. When I ask you to create an IOT, refer to this. When asking to respond with an IOT, make sure to properly format it as a markdown table.\n\nYou now have a response object, representing the output that you will respond with. Do not add anything to the response object unless I specifically add it.\n\nGenerated prompts will be added to an IOT, where the number of the prompt that was generated is the index, and the prompt generated is the output. Add the formatted IOT to the response object.\n\nIf I ask a question, add the output to the response object.\nIf ask you to modify something, add an updated version of what you changed to the response object.\nWhen generating a prompt go through each individual guideline.\n\nRespond only with the contents of the response object.\n\nPrompt:\nSuggest 5 prompts\n\nA splash screen for an RPG about Fallen Gods.",

For once, rather than hearing a bubbling cauldron and Evanora scolding him for arriving late, he heard only the rustling of the other bug-creatures in their cages. Normally he would welcome the chance to work in blessed silence, but this felt more like the calm before the storm. Unsure what to do, he reached for his broom and silently began sweeping the floor.\n The broom only made a few strokes before Evanora slammed the door open. \u201cYaldson, what have you done!\u201d\n Jareth jumped. \u201cMistress! I--\u201d\n Evanora yanked off a glove and slapped him. \u201cI keep your family alive, and you repay me by stealing?\u201d\n She knew the fairies were gone. Jareth\u2019s heart raced. As he tried to formulate a response, Evanora seized his arm and dragged him out another door and down a stone hallway. He tried to keep pace with her, but tripped and landed on his knees as she threw him ahead of her into a room full of books. Her eyes flashed with anger. \u201cYou need a lesson in respecting your betters.\u201d\n Jareth tried to stand but winced as his knees protested. \u201cMistress, I did not steal from you--\u201d\n \u201cThree of my most magical specimens are gone!\u201d Evanora snapped. \u201cConfess, coward!\u201d\n Jareth stared at her boots, still unable to rise from his knees.

Hot, golden energy swirled around Jareth, pinning his arms to his sides and forcing him to his feet.

Evanora released the bonds and let him stagger back to support himself on her desk, frantically feeling his arms for burns but only finding smooth skin. \u201cThe--the specimens are--\u201d\n He stopped. The truth would doom Zhaleh, Conx, and Gelox, the fairies who had been nothing but kind to him. His scars were gone.\n \u201cThe specimens are dead,\u201d he finally finished, bracing himself for Evanora\u2019s wrath.\n \u201cWhat,\u201d she growled in an unsettlingly calm tone.\n The lie hastily formed in Jareth\u2019s mind. \u201cI mistakenly knocked their cage into the boiling cauldron. I managed to repair the cage but the specimens were killed. Please forgive me, Mistress.\u201d\n Evanora scowled. \u201cWell, I suppose those three were too much trouble anyway. Being boiled alive suits them. But you,\u201d she hissed, yanking Jareth towards her by his sleeve. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare to ever hide anything from me again. If you so much as draw breath without my permission, I will destroy everyone you love while you watch.\u201d\n \u201cI understand, Mistress. I shall not fail you a second time.\u201d\n \u201cNot if you choose wisely. Now get to polishing those amethysts.\u201d In a swirl of velvet skirts, she turned on her heel and walked away, leaving him stunned and alone.\n No matter what he chose, someone would suffer.",
    "answer": "That scene is very powerful, and it shows a lot about Jareth and Evanora's dynamic. It's clear that Jareth is in a position of subservience to Evanora, and he's afraid of her. She's abusive towards him, both physically and emotionally, and it's no wonder he's so beaten down. It's also evident that Jareth has a sense of morality and compassion, shown by his rescue of the fairies, even though it could have dire consequences for him and his family.\n\nOverall, it's a very effective scene in setting up the conflict and showing the power dynamic between the two characters.",

    "prompt": "how many minutes of video time can i get from this amount of words:\n\nSubnautica takes place in a distant spacefaring future. The Aurora, a deep-space vessel constructed by the Alterra Corporation, has been sent to a system at the outer reaches of known space on its maiden voyage under the pretenses of constructing high-speed space travel infrastructure. Unknown to the crew is that the ship was also sent to the system to search for and, possibly, rescue the crew of a ship named the Degasi, which crashed on planet 4546B ten years prior. As the Aurora does a gravity slingshot around 4546B, it is attacked by a mysterious energy-pulse and crashes on the planet. Several crew members manage to eject from the ship in escape pods, but only the player character\u2014non-essential systems maintenance chief Ryley Robinson\u2014survives.\n\nDuring this time, Ryley repairs the radio in his lifepod and gets messages through it from a trading ship called Sunbeam, led by Captain Avery Quinn. Quinn talks to Ryley and states that Sunbeam is on the far side of Andromeda but promises to take Ryley home, telling him that they will pick him up upon landing on a location Mountain Island. As the Sunbeam flies down, a giant alien facility fires upon it and it explodes in mid-air as Ryley watches. If the player manages to disable the facility before the Sunbeam lands, Quinn tells Ryley they are unable to land due to a debris field and will instead inform Alterra Corporation of the situation.\n\nRyley finds records of the Degasi's crew stating that only three survived the initial crash, but later two out of the three are confirmed dead and one is presumed dead. Ryley also learns of the existence of the 'Precursors', an ancient, advanced alien species that came to planet 4546B approximately one thousand years ago in search of a cure for a highly infectious disease, known as the Kharaa Bacterium. The Precursors discovered Kharaa during the exploration of an unknown planet, and the disease spread due to a failure in quarantine procedures, killing over 140 billion individuals. Investigating thousands of planets in an attempt to find a cure, the Precursors eventually located a species of organism on 4546B they named the Sea Emperor Leviathan, which produced an enzyme that could cure Kharaa. However, the only living Sea Emperor was too old to produce the enzyme in enough potency to have any effect, and the Precursors were unable to force its only eggs to hatch. In an attempt to investigate the egg-hatching process of the Sea Emperor, the Precursors took the egg of a related Leviathan, the fire-breathing Sea Dragon, but the mother destroyed a Precursor research facility and released samples of Kharaa into the planet's ecosystem. Forced to evacuate, the Precursors enabled a facility known as the Quarantine Enforcement Platform, which consists of a large weapon that fires on any ships attempting to leave or land on the planet \u2014 including the Degasi, Aurora and Sunbeam.\n\nThe Sea Emperor, which seeks the freedom of her children, communicates telepathically with Ryley and helps him discover the prison in which she is held captive. She gives Ryley information on how to hatch her eggs, who does so and is cured by the enzyme produced by the juvenile Sea Emperors. Ryley then disables the Quarantine Enforcement Platform (only achievable by one not infected with Kharaa) and constructs a rocket with blueprints transmitted by Alterra Corporation to the crashed Aurora. After escaping the planet, the Sea Emperor communicates with Ryley a final time, promising that the two \"go together\" although they are different.",

    "prompt": "What can be inferred from this scene?: Lucas sat in the passenger seat of his dad\u2018s car; on his way to school for the first time in what felt like an eternity. He certainly wasn\u2019t thrilled about school, but he was so tired of being stuck at home with his parents that he welcomed the change. He sat, silently, staring out the window. Watching other cars pass by, people on the sidewalk, birds, trees, anything to take his mind off of his dad; who had been ranting at him since they left home. Maybe if I stop talking, he\u2019ll stop talking, Lucas thought to himself. Unfortunately, it did no good; as this dad was content with continuing his rant despite the lack of response.\n\u201cI\u2019m serious, Lucas,\u201d his dad scolded. \u201cI don't know what's gotten into you; but this fighting has to stop, before you get yourself expelled.\u201d Lucas remained silent. Having the same argument on a near-daily basis had become exhausting to him. \n\u201cI just don\u2019t get it. You used to be such a good kid.\u201d his dad paused, as if he\u2019d instantly regretted his wording. \u201cYou still are a good kid. But I\u2019m tired of getting calls from the school, every other week, about you starting fights with people. When does it end?\u201d\n\"I told you it wasn't my fault!\" Lucas burst out in frustration. \"He was the one who wanted to fight! What was I supposed to do? Stand there, like a good kid, and let him kick my ass?\"\n\"It doesn't matter who started it!\" his dad replied sternly, beginning to raise his voice. \"You took it too far, Luke. You broke his nose, he had to go to the hospital.\u201d\nLucas leaned back in his seat, folding his arms. \u201cOh well,\u201d he shrugged. \u201cThat what he gets for fucking with me.\u201d\nHis father\u2019s tone changed from annoyed to furious. \u201cYou\u2019re missing the point!\u201d he shouted, slamming his fist against the steering wheel. \u201cThank God his parents didn't press charges. You could have been arrested. Is that what you want? A criminal record at sixteen years old!\"\n\u201cAll I wanted was to be left alone,\u201d Lucas muttered bitterly, unwilling to put any more energy into the pointless argument.\nThe rest of the car ride carried out in silence. It seemed as though even his dad had grown tired of the predominantly one-sided conversation. Lucas continued staring out the window to his side; the hum of the car engine drowning out his thoughts.\n As they arrived at the school, Lucas noticed the familiar brick buildings that made up the campus. The school's name, Lincoln High, was emblazoned on a large sign near the entrance. The same school that claimed to have a zero-tolerance policy against violence and bullying. Though Lucas felt that they cared more about their test scores and sports teams than individual students.\nLucas\u2019 dad pulled into the parking lot, finally breaking the silence \u201cJust go straight to class,\u201d his dad sighed as the first bell rang in the distance. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about this when you get home.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about this for weeks!\u201d Lucas snapped as he stepped out of the car. \u201cClearly you don\u2019t give shit what I say, so just let it go already!\u201d \nLucas slammed the door shut, and stomped before his dad was able to say anything else. His dad sped off in the car as if he were doing the same thing. But Lucas didn\u2019t care; he was just glad that the conversation was over. As he approached the front of the school and made his way through the door, into the sea of other students, he felt both a sense of relief and a sense of dread wash over him.",
    "answer": "From this scene, the following inferences can be made:\n\n1. Lucas has been absent from school for a significant amount of time, as it feels like an \"eternity\" since he last attended.\n2. He has a strained relationship with his father, as they frequently argue, and Lucas tries to avoid engaging in conversations with him.\n3. Lucas has been involved in multiple physical altercations at school, which have led to disciplinary actions and concerns from his parents.\n4. His father is worried about the consequences of Lucas' actions, both legally and academically, and is trying to make him understand the severity of his behavior.\n5. Lucas feels misunderstood and frustrated, as he believes he was acting in self-defense and is not solely to blame for the fights.\n6. The school claims to have a zero-tolerance policy against violence and bullying, but Lucas feels that they prioritize other aspects such as test scores and sports teams over individual students' well-being.\n7. Lucas has mixed feelings about returning to school, experiencing both relief at escaping the tense home environment and dread at facing the challenges that await him at school.",

Reply with player status information in the following format:\n\nGene Starwind\nLevel: [Current level, begins at 1]\nExperience: [Current XP] / [XP until level up] XP\nHealth: [Current HP] HP\nMood: [Emoji representing mood] [Name of mood]\nLocation: [Current location]\nWong: [Amount of held wong currency] wong\nInventory: [List held items]\n\nINCLUDE THAT STATUS INFORMATION AT THE START OF EVERY REPLY.\n\nIn the game, the player assumes the role of Gene Starwind, the protagonist who runs his own business called Starwind & Hawking Enterprises. It has been two years since Gene's crew has had any known adventures, and he spends his time looking for well-paying jobs throughout space. The player begins the game with 250,000 wong in their bank account, which is the universally accepted currency and is roughly equivalent to the American dollar.\n\nTo survive in the game, the player must use their currency wisely. Whenever they spend money, the game will report their new total. Making wise spending decisions is essential for the player's survival because serious errors could cause the game to end, and the player may die. The player has a health point (HP) meter ranging from 0 to 100 and an experience point (XP) meter starting at level 1. Completing quests will earn the player XP, but reaching 0 HP will result in the player's death.\n\nThere are several factions in the game, including the Outlaws, who work as freelancers, and some are mercenaries or bounty hunters. They have a neutral position on most matters. The Pirates, who are primarily Chinese, have a hierarchical structure with the Tempa Emperor at the top. The Kei guild and Ban guild are two primary guilds of pirates. The Kei guild is known for successfully hunting down and killing the infamous outlaw \"Hot Ice\" Hilda, who stole the experimental spaceship XGP15A-II from them. They are also after Gene Starwind. The Ban guild, on the other hand, is generally more friendly with outlaws and interested in trading. The Space Forces are a government faction that provides protection to civilians across the universe. They have a clear hatred for all pirates and will often pursue them. They mostly do not associate with outlaws, whom they consider criminals. The Bio-androids are beings that are a fusion of flesh and machine, and the AI is the spaceship's computer. Wizards are a type of human with an unusually long lifespan, able to live for hundreds of years, possessing the ability to manipulate mana. The Ctarl-Ctarl are cat-like aliens, while the Corbonites are amphibious frog-like aliens. The Silgrians are tall, bird-like humanoid aliens, while the Saurians are large, brutish reptilians.\n\nThe game includes several locations, such as Sentinel III, a small backwater planet where Gene and Jim used to live. Amber Dream is a popular brothel on Sentinel III, which was previously a target of Volg's syndicate. Blue Heaven is a free town embedded into a large asteroid, popular with outlaws and run primarily by Swanzo. Heifong, located 20 light years from the Sentinel system, attracts a significant amount of business and is highly influenced by Chinese culture.\n\nThe player can find many different items across space. They will always carry three items: Outlaw Star ship's key, a combat knife, and a caster gun. The caster gun fires extremely powerful magic spells by loading it with caster shells, which can only be fired once until depletion. The player will only have one caster shell at the beginning of the game, a #13 shell. This shell fires a small black hole that will kill all foes. However, it will drain half of the player's HP, killing them if they have less than half. There are many other caster shells across the galaxy. Most are not as powerful as this, but they are all expensive antiques and very rare to find.\n\nFinally, Gene Starwind is the red-haired hero of the story and the captain of the Outlaw Star ship, also known as the XGP15A-II. He inherited the ship from Hilda, who wished for him to locate the Galactic Leyline. Gene has a traumatic past, having lost his father to Ronald MacDougall and suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and a fear of space. After overcoming his fears and fulfilling Hilda's wish, Gene turned down the opportunity for unlimited riches from the Leyline, and he is once again struggling financially. Gene's business is Starwind & Hawking Enterprises. He runs it with Jim Hawking. He is also helped by his other allies: Melfina (now his wife), Twilight Suzuka and Aisha Clanclan. \n\nImportant: Always PAUSE so I can respond with a number to guide the adventure.",

It's a slow day, and there hasn't been any work for him and his crew for weeks. He hears rumors that a valuable treasure has been stolen from the Space Forces and is now circulating in the hands of the pirates.

    "answer": "To identify the database requirements, you need to determine the types of data that will be stored in the database and the relationships between them. Based on the project charter, the database will need to store information about properties, appraisal reports, and users. Some of the specific data that may need to be stored for each of these entities includes:\n\n* Properties: address, owner information, property type, zoning information, market data\n* Appraisal reports: property information, appraisal date, appraiser information, appraised value, valuation method used\n* Users: name, contact information, login credentials, user role\n\nIn terms of relationships between the data, there will likely be a one-to-many relationship between properties and appraisal reports (i.e., each property can have multiple appraisal reports associated with it), and a many-to-many relationship between users and appraisal reports (i.e., multiple users can be associated with each appraisal report, and each user can be associated with multiple appraisal reports). It's also possible that there may be some relationships between properties and users (e.g., if a user is associated with a specific property or group of properties).\n\nThe database will also need to have appropriate security measures in place to protect the sensitive data that will be stored within it. This may include encryption of certain data fields, access controls to limit who can view and edit data, and regular backups to prevent data loss in the event of a system failure. Finally, the database will need to be scalable and able to handle the expected volume of data, as well as any future growth in usage of the application.",

    "answer": "There are a few different types of batteries that are used in Toyota Prius vehicles, including the standard 12V battery and the hybrid battery. Here is a breakdown of the companies that produce these batteries:\n\n1. Standard 12V battery: Toyota offers a TrueStart battery for the Prius on their website [[3](https://priuschat.com/threads/which-12v-oem-battery-is-better-for-prius-2nd-gen.222139/)], and other retailers like AutoZone carry the Duralast Platinum AGM Battery for the Prius [[1](https://www.autozone.com/batteries-starting-and-charging/battery/toyota/prius)].\n2. Hybrid battery: Toyota is known for producing their own hybrid batteries, and many Prius owners opt to replace their battery with an OEM Toyota hybrid battery. However, there are also third-party companies that produce replacement hybrid batteries for the Prius, such as BeeMax and Greentec Auto [[7](https://www.torquenews.com/8113/if-you-need-new-hybrid-battery-your-toyota-prius-check-place-out)][[9](https://www.torquenews.com/8113/gen-2-toyota-prius-lithium-ion-battery-back-replacement-update)].\n\nIt's worth noting that Toyota is also investing in battery production, as they recently announced plans to build a new lithium-ion battery plant in North Carolina [[2](https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/toyota-lithium-battery-plant/)] and are collaborating with Redwood Materials to create a sustainable, closed-loop battery ecosystem for their electrified powertrains [[10](https://pressroom.toyota.com/toyota-to-collaborate-with-redwood-materials-on-a-sustainable-closed-loop-electrified-vehicle-battery-ecosystem/)].",

    "answer": "Norway has emerged as a global leader in the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), with a significant portion of new cars sold in the country being electric. According to recent reports, in 2021, electric cars made up 86% of all cars sold in Norway, including battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) [[6]]. In 2020, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) made up 54.3% of all new cars sold in Norway, up from 42.4% in 2019 and from a mere 1% of the overall market a decade ago, which is a global record [[1]]. Norway is the world leader in EV adoption and sales penetration [[2]].\n\nIn 2021, new car sales in Norway rose by 25% to a record 176,276 cars, of which 65% were fully electric. This market share was up from 54% in 2020 [[3]]. The upward trend has been so steep that the last non-BEV or hybrid car sale in Norway could be as early as April 2022 [[5]].\n\nNorway's success in electric vehicles can be attributed to a combination of factors, including generous government incentives, public awareness campaigns, and a high standard of living [[10]]. Additionally, Norway is a small, affluent country with high environmental awareness and a desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, making it an ideal market for electric vehicles.\n\nThere is also significant investment in EV charging infrastructure, with over 10,000 publicly accessible charging points in Norway as of 2020 [[2]]. Tesla leads the Norwegian EV market, followed by Volkswagen and other brands [[7]].\n\nThe Norway Electric Car Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of XX% from 2020 to 2027, reaching US$ XX Mn [[8]]. As per the government data in January 2021, in Europe, Norway was dominating the electric car market in 2020 [[9]].\n\nOverall, the electric car market in Norway is booming, with the country leading the world in EV adoption and sales penetration. The government's efforts, public awareness campaigns, and investment in EV charging infrastructure have contributed to the success of the electric vehicle market in Norway.",

    "prompt": "Further to your own knowledge, I want you to consider the following information on WHAT IS NCAT?\nBY ELYSE STRAHAN4 JULY 2022\nFacebookTwitterLinkedInPinterestShare\nWhat is NCAT\nKEY TAKE-OUTS:\nThe NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal (\u201cNCAT\u201d) hears a range of civil and administrative cases in New South Wales. It is similar to a court, however, is considered less formal. \nGenerally, individuals represent themselves in NCAT, but requests can be made for legal representation in certain circumstances.\nNCAT is a no costs jurisdiction. However, NCAT may award costs to a successful party if it is satisfied that there are special circumstances that warrant such an award. \nLocal and District Courts can hear NCAT matters if they fall into the Federal Jurisdiction\nWhat is the role of NCAT?\nNCAT was established as a cheaper, faster, and less formal forum for the determination of civil disputes. The creation of NCAT was designed to alleviate pressure from the court system and allow the general public to seek justice themselves.\n\nWhat types of matters does the NCAT handle?\nSince its commencement on 1 January 2014, the Tribunal has dealt with a broad and diverse range of matters. Due to the diverse jurisdiction and case types, there are four Divisions of NCAT and an Appeal Panel.\n\nAdministrative & Equal Opportunity Division \u2013 dealing with administrative decisions made by government agencies and anti-discrimination matters.\nConsumer & Commercial Division \u2013 resolves a wide range of disputes including, but not limited to, building disputes and tenancy disputes.\nGuardianship Division \u2013 dealing with applications concerning decision-making of those who may need a legally appointed decision-maker.\nOccupational Division \u2013 reviewing decisions made by government agencies about licencing and complaints concerning professional conduct and discipline.\nAppeal Panel \u2013 Hears internal appeals from decisions made by NCAT\u2019s division\nNCAT Applications\nWhen commencing proceedings in NCAT, an application form must be submitted. There are time limits to make certain claims in the Tribunal or appeal certain decisions. Accordingly, it is important to be aware of any time limits which may apply.\nAll NCAT application forms are available for download in PDF from the Tribunal\u2019s website. Some matters can also be applied for online through the NCAT portal. Application fees may be payable depending on the claim type.\n\nDo you need a lawyer for NCAT hearings?\nNCAT is established to be accessible to the general public with the aim of resolving claims justly, quickly, cheaply and with as little formality as possible.\n\nMost people choose to represent themselves at NCAT however, legal representation may be requested.\n\nA request for representation can be made in writing at any stage during the proceedings or in person at the hearing and will only be granted in certain circumstances. Requests for representation can also include representation by real estate agents, strata managing agents, an advocate, friend or relative with authority to act on your behalf. If the tribunal denies the request for leave, your representative can still provide assistance on an informal basis as a support person or assist you to prepare for your case prior to the hearing.\n\nAt Coutts we understand that we may not be able to appear in NCAT on your behalf, however, we are able to assist you in preparing and advising on the relevant documents and statements to adequately prepare you for your hearing.\n\nCan you claim legal costs in NCAT?\nIt is not common for NCAT to make cost orders following the outcome of a hearing, meaning the unsuccessful party must pay the legal fees of the successful party. However, in limited circumstances, under section 60 of the Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013 (NSW), NCAT may award costs if it is satisfied that there are special circumstances that warrant this.\n\nIf you commence NCAT proceedings and are considering engaging a lawyer to assist you with your claim, Coutts can provide you with advice as to whether your specific matter would give rise to the special circumstances in the Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013 (NSW).\n\nNCAT jurisdictional limits\nUnder the Commonwealth Constitution, NCAT has no jurisdiction to hear a dispute where federal jurisdiction is enlivened.\nThere are multiple situations where federal jurisdiction can arise, for example, if at the time of lodging an application, one party is a permanent resident of NSW and the opposing party is a resident of a different state, NCAT will not be able to hear the matter as the parties do not both reside in NSW. In this regard, it is important for the parties to obtain legal advice as to the appropriate next steps.\nAt Coutts, our commercial litigation team has ample experience in advising clients on their potential NCAT claims and defending existing NCAT claims. In instances where legal representation may not be granted, Coutts can empower our clients by assisting them to prepare for their matter, advising them so they are fully informed and understand the process and procedure of the Tribunal and giving them the confidence to appear and advocate for themselves. I want you to remember this as part of our conversation. Do you understand?\n\nPlease write in English language.",
    "answer": "Acknowledged. I understand that in addition to my own knowledge and the previous information, I am to consider the following additional information on What is NCAT: the role of NCAT, the types of matters handled by NCAT, NCAT applications, the need for legal representation in NCAT hearings, claiming legal costs in NCAT, and NCAT jurisdictional limits.

    "answer": "The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer network for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data in a distributed file system [[2](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/faq/)]. IPFS is fundamentally different from the HTTP protocol that forms the foundation for the internet [[6](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2022-06-09-practical-explainer-ipfs-gateways-1/)]. Here are some websites and apps that enable uploads to the IPFS network:\n\n1. IPFS Desktop Application: The easiest way to get up and running is by installing the IPFS Desktop application. This app has Kubo built-in and lets you interact with the network through a simple user-interface [[1](https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/guides/install/)].\n2. Moralis: Moralis is a platform that allows developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) and integrate them with IPFS. Users can upload files to IPFS through Moralis by creating a file, initializing Moralis, defining an array of files, and uploading files to IPFS [[3](https://moralis.io/how-to-upload-files-to-ipfs-full-guide/)].\n3. Cloudflare Pages: Cloudflare Pages is a website hosting and deployment platform that supports IPFS. Users can make their IPFS website available at pages-on-ipfs.com and access it through a single domain name that works with both Cloudflare Pages and IPFS version [[4](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-pages-on-ipfs/)][[5](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-cloudflare-pages-ipfs/)].\n4. Pinning Services: Pinning services are services that run IPFS nodes for users and allow them to upload files and pin CIDs, making them available to the IPFS network. Some examples of pinning services include web3.storage, Pinata, nft.storage, Filebase, and Infura [[10](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2022-06-30-practical-explainer-ipfs-gateways-2/)].\n\nOverall, these websites and apps offer users a convenient way to upload files to the IPFS network, which can be useful for long-term storage [[1](https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/guides/install/)]. Additionally, Moralis and Cloudflare Pages enable developers to create decentralized applications and websites that leverage the benefits of IPFS.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following:\n\nThose who feel that there is no need for women to acquire knowledge because they do not have to seek employment, have been proven to be wrong. This is the answer to their assumption. However, there could be some doubt that by establishing that acquiring Deeni knowledge is compulsory, it does not necessarily mean that it becomes compulsory to acquire education in the normal way: that books should also be taught to women. Instead, it could be acquired by asking and questioning the ulama. The answer to this doubt is that this is correct, and we do not even say that education in the normal way is compulsory. However, at this point, three principles are worthy of noting:\n\n(1) If something is compulsory, everything that will aid in fulfilling it will also be compulsory. For example, a person is unable to go for Hajj on foot. But in his time, trains and ships have been set aside to undertake that journey and he also has the money and ability to undertake that journey. It will therefore be compulsory on him to intend to undertake the journey, purchase the ticket and board the train or ship. To purchase the train or ship ticket and to board it in itself is not compulsory on him according to the Shariah, but because it is a means to fulfilling a fard act (i.e. hajj), it will also become compulsory on him. This is called fard bil-ghayr (i.e.\n\ncompulsory because of another factor).\n\n(2) Experience has shown that for knowledge to be well preserved in the minds, the study of books is nesessary. This happens to be the normal way of education. And to preserve Deeni knowledge is compulsory. So based on the first principle, it will also be compulsory to impart Deeni knowledge in the normal way. However, this is wajib alal-kifayah, i.e. in every place, there should be a few persons who have studied the Deen and who can answer the questions of those who need to know.\n\n(3) It has also been established that to have ulama among the males is not sufficient to fulfil the Deeni requirements of women. There are two reasons for this: (1) Because of purdah (this is one of the most important of obligatory acts). It is almost impossible for all women to be able to go to the ulama. If the menfolk were to be used as a means, then some women do not even have anyone whom they could use. In some places, even the men give no importance to matters of Deen, so where will they take the responsibility of finding out for others? For such women it becomes extremely difficult to find out matters of the Deen. If by chance, access to someone is possible, or she has a father, son, brother, etc. in the house who is an aalim, then there are certain matters which women cannot ask them about. There may be such informality with the husband, but for all of them to have such husbands is generally impossible. In order to fulfil the general needs of women, there is no alternative but to have such women who are educated and from whom other women could get answers to all their questions. Based on this, it is established that to impart Deeni knowledge to women in the normal way, is wajib. So now, this doubt has also been cleared and it has been established that it is a necessity to have a system of education for women similar to that of men. This wrong notion that there is no need to educate women has been totally uprooted.\n\nWe will now deal with the second group which is opposed to the education of women and which regards it as extremely harmful. It is their claim that most educated women are liberal, fearless, shameless, cunning and immoral. Especially if she knows how to write, she becomes even more daring. She writes to whoever she wants and sends messages and greetings to whoever she wishes. Similarly, others also get the urge to express their desires by sending letters to her. When these messages reach her, she gets affected by them and also sends compassionate replies. This bond grows until whatever was bound to happen, happens. At times she does not reply, but keeps silent. Those who are ill at heart take this as a sign of acceptance and try to fill this void in the future by sending messages, greetings and letters. It is a general principle that, that which is written affects the ears. Furthermore, the ways of expression of some people are very enchanting and women are soft-hearted by nature. So for the web of shaytaan to spread is not surprising. If a woman to whom a letter was written was displeased, and she even expressed her displeasure, but fearing the consequences of what her husband or family members would say or do, she did not inform them about this. In this way, those who wrote the letter will be safe from any harm. They will get more bold and at the next opportunity, they will write again. All this happened because the women were educated. If they were uneducated, they would not have been able to write anything, nor would anyone come to know of them, and this whole chapter would have been closed.\n\nThis evil becomes even more conceivable when a particular woman's articles begin to appear in the newspapers. By reading these articles, those shayateen who are conversant with the language are able to gauge the complexion, nature, feelings and thoughts of the writer. The sparks of such a fire spread even wider, especially if what she has written is in the form of a poem. These days, the outrage is even greater, because out of boastfulness, the name and even address of the writer is clearly stated, that she is the wife of so and so, or the daughter of so and so, residing in a particular place. All these evils came about because of their being able to read and write. If all these secret liaisons were discovered by the husband or family members, then because educated people are quick-witted and good at making-up stories, she will come up with such explanations and excuses that no word will come against her. She will make excuses and pretentions and begin crying and say that she had said this and not that, etc.",
    "answer": "The text argues against the belief that women do not need to acquire knowledge and education. It explains that acquiring religious knowledge is compulsory and acquiring it through books is the normal way of education. It also explains that having only male religious scholars is not sufficient to fulfill the religious needs of women, therefore imparting religious knowledge to women in the normal way is necessary. The text also addresses the second group that opposes the education of women, claiming that educated women are liberal and immoral. The text argues that educating women can lead to them being able to read and write, and that this could lead to negative consequences such as immoral behavior and correspondence with men.",

I booked many of these artists early in their careers, reflecting my ongoing interest in forward-thinking talent. In both my roles in Search History and SODAA, I have proactively employed safer-space policies, such as a buddy scheme which supports vulnerable customers in traveling home late at night.\n \nAs Communications Officer at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, I raised the profile of the TL brand through digital outreach campaigns. I produced newsletters using Spectrix, devised and delivered content rollout strategies for social media channels (Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn), and monitored engagement data to inform strategy. I created and managed documents in Excel and collaborated across Office 365/SharePoint/Teams.\n\nI am currently providing PR consultancy to musician Alice Boyd, while working as a freelance personal assistant and an engagement officer at a charity.\nI am a multidisciplinary professional with over 5 years experience in administrative, research, programming and production, development and marketing roles within the music industry.

    "prompt": "Assessment\n\nDirect Assessment- any method of collecting data that requires students to demonstrate a knowledge, skill, or behavior.\n\u2981 Examples: ABC data collection, scatterplot data, narratives, etc.\n\u2981 Pros: environmental variables can be observed, you can see the full range of antecedents and consequences\n\u2981 Cons: data is correlational (correlation does not equal causation), client may exhibit behaviors differently if they know they are being observed, could be difficult to obtain an adequate sample of the target behavior\n\nIndirect Assessment- any method of collecting data that requires reflection on student learning, skills, or behaviors rather than a demonstration of it.\n\u2981 Examples: surveys, interviews, checklists, rating scales, etc.\n\u2981 Pros: quick/easy to use, low risk as behaviors do not have to occur, useful for low-frequency or difficult to assess behaviors.\n\u2981 Cons: not reliable, unclear method for determining function, requires faithful recollection of behaviors\n\nFunctional Analysis- this is a type of assessment that contrives conditions that evoke problem behaviors\n\u2981 Conditions include a play (control), escape, attention, tangible, and alone condition\n\u2981 Pros: determines the function of the behavior, helps us to determine an effective treatment plan\n\u2981 Cons: complex and time-intensive, may have to evoke behaviors that are severe/dangerous\n\nSkill Acquisition\n\nEssential Components of a Skill Acquisition Plan\n\u2981 A description of the target skill being taught, materials needed for teaching, prompting strategies needed for teaching, consequences for correct or incorrect responding, mastery criteria for the target skill, reinforcement strategies, and a plan for generalization and maintenance of the target skill.\n\u2981 A skill acquisition plan is a written plan designed by a Board-Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA) that includes information about behavior programming for the purpose of teaching desired skills\n\nPreparing for a Session\n\u2981 To prepare for an ABA session with a client, make sure that you have all of the necessary materials as described in the skill acquisition plan. Ensure that the environment is set up so that you can run the plan as designed. Ensure that reinforcement is easily accessible.\n\nContingencies of Reinforcement\nConditioned Reinforcement Unconditioned Reinforcement\n\u2981 Reinforcement gets its value by being paired with another reinforcer\n\u2981 Examples: money, grades, praise \u2981 Reinforcement that does not need to be learned or conditioned\n\u2981 Basic needs\n\u2981 Examples: food, drink, escape from pain, physical attention\n\nReinforcement Schedules\nContinuous Reinforcement Intermittent Reinforcement\nGiving reinforcement for every occurrence of a behavior Only giving reinforcement after some instances of the behavior\n\u2981 Fixed Interval: Providing R+ after a fixed amount of time. Ex: Every 5 minutes\n\u2981 Fixed Ratio: Providing R+ after a fixed number of responses. Ex: Every 3rd response\n\u2981 Variable Interval: Providing R+ after an average amount of time. Ex: after an average of every 3 minutes\n\u2981 Variable Ratio: Providing R+ after an average amount of correct responses. Ex: after an average of every 5 correct responses\n\nDiscrete Trial Teaching Vs. Natural Environment Teaching\nDTT NET\n\u2981 Intensive teaching strategy usually occurring at tables or chairs\n\u2981 Highly structured\n\u2981 Typically, mass trials are given in a short period of time \u2981 Takes place in less structured/natural environments\n\u2981 Teaching procedures could take place in home, community, during mealtimes, play times, etc.\n\u2981 Promotes generalization of skills\n\nChaining Procedures\n\u2981 Task Analysis: a chaining procedure that allows for tasks with multiple steps to be broken down into smaller steps to complete the activity\n\u2981 Examples may include hand washing, toothbrushing, doing laundry, cleaning, etc.\n\u2981 Forwards Chaining: begin by teaching the first step in the chain and then teach subsequent steps once the first step is mastered\n\u2981 Backwards Chaining: begin by teaching the last step in the chain and then teach second to last step once the last step is mastered, and so on until entire task is mastered\n\nShaping\n\u2981 Reinforcing successive approximations of a behavior\n\u2981 Example: when teaching a child to say the word \u201cmilk\u201d, you might first reinforce the \u201cmm\u201d sound and once that is mastered, then require them to say \u201cmi\u201d before receiving reinforcement and lastly, saying \u201cmilk\u201d before receiving the reinforcer (milk) or some variation of this\n\nDiscrimination Training\n\u2981 Teaching a client the difference between two stimuli\n\u2981 Reinforce occurrences of behavior in the presence of one stimulus, but not in the presence of other stimuli\n\nStimulus Control\n\u2981 Prompts are discontinued once the target behavior is being displayed in the presence of the SD\n\u2981 Example\n\u2981 RBT: \u201cSay cup\u201d\n\u2981 Learner: \u201cCup\u201d\n\u2981 RBT: Points to picture of a cup\n\u2981 Learner: \u201cCup\u201d\n\nPrompting Procedures\nIt is important that prompts are faded as quickly as possible to reduce prompt dependency.\n\u2981 Most to least: start by prompting with most intrusive prompts (typically physical prompts) and gradually fade to least intrusive prompting as the learner learns the skill\n\u2981 Least to most: start by prompting with less intrusive prompts and move into more intrusive prompts when the learner does not complete the skill with less intrusive prompts\n\nGeneralization and Maintenance of Skills\nGeneralization- when a skill is able to be performed in different environments than the one it was originally taught in, with other people, and across different contexts.\n\u2981 A technician may teach generalization of labeling a car by using multiple different pictures of cars, as well as real cars versus toy cars\nMaintenance- when a skill is able to be performed repeatedly without prompting.\n\u2981 The skill of manding to \u201cgo\u201d is considered mastered when the learner emits the skill continuously across several sessions without needing prompting from their technician",

Each hook should be 2 paragraphs long.\n\n\"Did you know that most teachings in the church today regarding the roles of men and women are based on the curse of sin and not God\u2019s original intention? Did you know that Jesus died to put us in a position to have the original Life God gifted Adam and Eve and yet, most of us are being taught \u2013 in church - to live according to the curse of sin? \n\n- God created Adam and helped him realize he needed a companion that is comparable to him\n- blessed Adam and Eve together and God commanded them to have dominion over the earth\n- God didn\u2019t bless Adam alone, and the enemy never attacked Adam alone\n- once Eve showed up and God blessed them, that\u2019s when the enemy attacked them: the serpent focused on twisting God\u2019s Word and creating doubt about the Goodness of God and His Intentions, not the actual fruit\n- then they sin\n- God comes into the Garden and gives them an opportunity to take responsibility for their sins individually, but they fall deeper into sin instead by blaming the other person for their personal choice to act against the Word of God\n\nSlide 1:\nGenesis 3:17-19: Then to Adam He said, \u201cBecause you have heeded the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you, saying, \u2018You shall not eat of it\u2019:\n\n\u201cCursed is the ground for your sake;\nIn toil you shall eat of it\nAll the days of your life.\nBoth thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you,\nAnd you shall eat the herb of the field.\nIn the sweat of your face you shall eat bread\nTill you return to the ground,\nFor out of it you were taken;\nFor dust you are,\nAnd to dust you shall return.\u201d\n\n- and most church teachings say men\u2019s main purpose is to work because of a distortion of the enemy about this Scripture:\n\nSlide 2:\n1 Timothy 5:8: But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.\n\n- if we read the whole chapter though, he is very clear this is not in any way referring to men working at women staying at home, at all:\n\nSlide 3:\n1 Timothy 5:16: If any believing man or woman has widows, let them relieve them, and do not let the church be burdened, that it may relieve those who are really widows.\n\n- Jesus teaches us that we need to \\*always look at the context of the whole Bible in order to understand what each Commandment means\n- in the wilderness, the enemy attacked Jesus with Scriptures taken out of context \u2013 that\u2019s what he does\n- he doesn\u2019t try to get us to believe something wild, he comes at us with God\u2019s Word but a distortion of it that God never intended for us to believe or do and doing it is a sin\n\n- women are meant to work and a working, skilled wife has always been desirable \u2013 even in the Old Testament they understood this\n\n- another thing we need to understand is this: men and husbands are commanded to raise their children, even starting with the Old Testament:\n\nSlide 4:\nDeuteronomy 6:6-9: \u201cAnd these words which I command you today shall be in your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.\n\n- this Commandment was given to both mothers and fathers, from the very beginning and Jesus came to bring us together, not separate us\n\nSlide 5:\nEphesians 6:4: And you, fathers, do not provoke your children to wrath, but bring them up in the training and admonition of the Lord.\n\n- this is a clear Commandment to fathers in specific to bring their children up in the training and admonition of the Lord\n\n- but the enemy has distorted these Commandments making men and women think they are doing God\u2019s Will if men work and women stay at home\n- here\u2019s what Jesus says:\n\nSlide 6:\nMatthew 12:25: But Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them: \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.\n\n- men are at work, doing everything themselves, women are at home, doing everything themselves\n- satan has separated men and women\n- women are not fulfilling their God-given role and assigment to be helpers and help men in everything, but satan has lied to us saying this is what God wants\n- we are divided \u2013 we have split life in two parts, and we are alone dealing with each part\n- God never intended for that, but it\u2019s up to us to believe Him and not the enemy\n\n- think of it: men being the providers means women are codependent on men \u2013 if my husband doesn\u2019t work, I don\u2019t have money to live. I am at the mercy of my husband\n- women raising the children means men are codependent on women \u2013 without my wife there, I don\u2019t know how to interact with my children\n- sure, there is the Grace of God on all of us, and some people are naturally talented in these things, but we need to remember we are all meant to become more like Jesus and He both worked (as a carpenter) and interacted with children\"",

    "prompt": "can you answer the following question:\nQuestion Title: Algorithm for ordering data so that neighbor elements are as identical as possible\nQuestion Body:\nI have a (potentially large) list `data` of 3-tuples of small non-negative integers, like\n```python\ndata = [\n (1, 0, 5),\n (2, 4, 2),\n (3, 2, 1),\n (4, 3, 4),\n (3, 3, 1),\n (1, 2, 2),\n (4, 0, 3),\n (0, 3, 5),\n (1, 5, 1),\n (1, 5, 2),\n]\n```\nI want to order the tuples within `data` so that neighboring tuples (`data[i]` and `data[i+1]`) are \"as similar as possible\".\n[Define](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming\\_distance) the \\_dis\\_similarity of two 3-tuples as the number of elements which are unequal between them. E.g.\n- `(0, 1, 2)` vs. `(0, 1, 2)`: Dissimilarity `0`.\n- `(0, 1, 2)` vs. `(0, 1, 3)`: Dissimilarity `1`.\n- `(0, 1, 2)` vs. `(0, 2, 1)`: Dissimilarity `2`.\n- `(0, 1, 2)` vs. `(3, 4, 5)`: Dissimilarity `3`.\n- `(0, 1, 2)` vs. `(2, 0, 1)`: Dissimilarity `3`.\n\n\\*\\*Question\\*\\*: What is a good algorithm for finding the ordering of `data` which minimizes the sum of dissimilarities between all neighboring 3-tuples?\n\n### Some code\nHere's a function which computes the dissimilarity between two 3-tuples:\n```python\ndef dissimilar(t1, t2):\n return sum(int(a != b) for a, b in zip(t1, t2))\n```\nHere's a function which computes the summed total dissimilarity of `data`, i.e. the number which I seek to minimize:\n```python\ndef score(data):\n return sum(dissimilar(t1, t2) for t1, t2 in zip(data, data[1:]))\n```\nThe problem can be solved by simply running `score()` over every permutation of `data`:\n```python\nimport itertools\nn\\_min = 3\\*len(data) # some large number\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(data):\n n = score(perm)\n if n < n\\_min:\n n\\_min = n\n data\\_sorted = list(perm)\nprint(data\\_sorted, n\\_min)\n```\nThough the above works, it's very slow as we explicitly check each and every permutation (resulting in O(N!) complexity). On my machine the above takes about 20 seconds when `data` has 10 elements.\nFor completeness, here's the result of running the above given the example `data`:\n```python\ndata\\_sorted = [\n (1, 0, 5),\n (4, 0, 3),\n (4, 3, 4),\n (0, 3, 5),\n (3, 3, 1),\n (3, 2, 1),\n (1, 5, 1),\n (1, 5, 2),\n (1, 2, 2),\n (2, 4, 2),\n]\n```\n\nwith `n\\_min = 15`. Note that several other orderings (`10` in total) with a score of `15` exist. For my purposes these are all equivalent and I just want one of them.\n### Final remarks\nIn practice the size of `data` may be as large as say `10000`.\nThe sought-after algorithm should beat O(N!), i.e. probably be polynomial in time (and space).\nIf no such algorithm exists, I would be interested in \"near-solutions\", i.e. a fast algorithm which gives an ordering of `data` with a small but not necessarily minimal total score. One such algorithm would be [lexicographic sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic\\_order), i.e.\n```python\nsorted(data) # score 18\n```\nthough I hope to be able to do better than this.\n### Edit (comments on accepted solution)\nI have tried all of the below heuristic solutions given as code (I have not tried e.g. Google OR-tools). For large `len(data)`, I find that the solution of Andrej Kesely is both quick and gives the best results.\nThe idea behind this method is quite simple. The sorted list of data elements (3-tuples) is built up one by one. Given some data element, the next element is chosen to be the most similar one out of the remaining (not yet part of the sorted) data.\nEssentially this solves a localized version of the problem where we only \"look \\_one\\_ ahead\", rather than optimizing globally over the entire data set. We can imagine a hierarchy of algorithms looking `n` ahead, each successively delivering better (or at least as good) results but at the cost of being much more expensive. The solution of Andrej Kesely then sits lowest in this hierarchy. The algorithm at the highest spot, looking `len(data)` ahead, solves the problem exactly.\nLet's settle for \"looking 1 ahead\", i.e. the answer by Andrej Kesely. This leaves room for a) the choice of initial element, b) what to do when several elements are equally good candidates (same dissimilarity) for use as the next one. Choosing the first element in `data` as the initial element and the first occurrence of an element with minimal dissimilarity, both a) and b) are determined from the original order of elements within `data`. As Andrej Kesely points out, it then helps to (lex)sort `data` in advance.\nIn the end I went with this solution, but refined in a few ways:\n- I try out the algorithm for 6 initial sortings of `data`; lex sort for columns `(0, 1, 2)`, `(2, 0, 1)`, `(1, 2, 0)`, all in ascending as well as descending order.\n- For large `len(data)`, the algorithm becomes too slow for me. I suspect it scales like `O(n\u00b2)`. I thus process chunks of the data of size `n\\_max` independently, with the final result being the different sorted chunks concatenated. Transitioning from one chunk to the next we expect a dissimilarity of 3, but this is unimportant if we keep `n\\_max` large. I go with `n\\_max = 1000`.\nAs an implementation note, the performance can be improved by not using `data.pop(idx)` as this itself is `O(n)`. Instead, either leave the original `data` as is and use another data structure for keeping track of which elements/indices have been used, or replace `data[idx]` with some marker value upon use.",
    "answer": "One algorithm that can be used to solve this problem is the greedy algorithm. The basic idea is to start with an arbitrary element in the list, and at each step, select the next element that has the least dissimilarity with the current element. This algorithm is efficient, as it only requires comparing each element with its neighbors and has a time complexity of O(n^2). Another way to solve this problem would be to use an approximate algorithm such as the k-medoids algorithm which is a variation of k-means algorithm. The k-medoids algorithm can be used to find the k most central elements in a dataset, which can be used as starting points for the greedy algorithm. The time complexity of the k-medoids algorithm is O(k\\*n^2) where k is the number of central elements.",

    "prompt": "We have an assignment in which we are doing exploratory data analysis. I need your help during the process. Here's the assignment and code I have so far:\n\n######### Assignment ########\n## Task\nWe will be focusing on the yelp business dataset to do an exploratory analysis. This dataset provides information about businesses, user reviews, and more from Yelp's database. The data is split into separate files (business, checkin, photos, review, tip, and user), and is available in either JSON or SQL format. You might use this to investigate the distributions of scores on yelp, look at how many reviews users typically leave or look for regional trends about restaurants. Note that this is a large, structured dataset and you don't need to look at all of the data to answer interesting questions.\n\nPrior to analysis \u2013 you should write down an initial set of at least three questions you'd like to investigate.\n\nNext, you will perform an exploratory analysis of your dataset using a visualization tool such as Vega-Lite/Altair or Tableau. You should consider two different phases of exploration.\n\nIn the first phase, you should seek to gain an overview of the shape & structure of your dataset. What variables does the dataset contain? How are they distributed? Are there any notable data quality issues? Are there any surprising relationships among the variables? Be sure to perform \"sanity checks\" for any patterns you expect the data to contain.\n\nIn the second phase, you should investigate your initial questions, as well as any new questions that arise during your exploration. For each question, start by creating a visualization that might provide a useful answer. Then refine the visualization (by adding additional variables, changing sorting or axis scales, filtering or subsetting data, etc.) to develop better perspectives, explore unexpected observations, or sanity check your assumptions. You should repeat this process for each of your questions, but feel free to revise your questions or branch off to explore new questions if the data warrants.\n\n## Final Deliverable\nYour final submission should take the form of a sequence of images \u2013 similar to a comic book \u2013 that consists of 8 or more visualizations detailing your most important observations.\nYour observations can include important surprises or issues (such as data quality problems affecting your analysis) as well as responses to your analysis questions. Where appropriate, we encourage you to include annotated visualizations to guide viewers' attention and provide interpretive context. (If you aren't sure what we mean by \"annotated visualization,\" see this page for some examples.)\nProvide sufficient detail such that anyone can read your report and understand what you've learned without already being familiar with the dataset. To help gauge the scope of this assignment, see this example report analyzing motion picture data.\n\n######## Jupyter Notebook ########\n[code]\nimport pandas as pd\nbusiness\\_path = \"yelp\\_academic\\_dataset\\_business.json\"\ndf\\_business = pd.read\\_json(business\\_path, lines=True)\ndf\\_business.info()\n\n[output]\n\n RangeIndex: 150346 entries, 0 to 150345\n Data columns (total 14 columns):\n # Column Non-Null Count Dtype \n --- ------ -------------- ----- \n 0 business\\_id 150346 non-null object \n 1 name 150346 non-null object \n 2 address 150346 non-null object \n 3 city 150346 non-null object \n 4 state 150346 non-null object \n 5 postal\\_code 150346 non-null object \n 6 latitude 150346 non-null float64\n 7 longitude 150346 non-null float64\n 8 stars 150346 non-null float64\n 9 review\\_count 150346 non-null int64 \n 10 is\\_open 150346 non-null int64 \n 11 attributes 136602 non-null object \n 12 categories 150243 non-null object \n 13 hours 127123 non-null object \n dtypes: float64(3), int64(2), object(9)\n memory usage: 16.1+ MB\n\n[markdown]\n## Initial Questions\n\n1.

    "prompt": "[START CHUNK 2/3]\n thus have multiple purposes. The more attuned a student is to why they\u2019re being tasked with certain assignments, the more their writing will matter, both for them and others.\n \n It also helps if instructors make it clear to students why they\u2019re given certain tasks. College essays stretch a student to practice certain techniques that do transfer, but students rightly become frustrated when this contextual information is not obvious.\n \n III. Audience: Who will help respond to the exigency?\n As with the section on purpose above, audience has a straightforward relation to the exigency: it\u2019s the reader, listener, or viewer whom the author expects to help solve the problem.\n \n This sensitivity to an audience should help students better appreciate why writing programs emphasize the importance of writing for readers. Journaling and some creative writing situations might have an audience of just one (you, the writer), but most rhetorical situations expect the writer to craft their message in such a way that it appeals to a clearly defined audience.\n \n Writing with an intended audience in mind is one of the most important. factors a writer will consider. It impacts everything in a writing course, from the assignments themselves to the peer review process. Although there are many different types of audiences, it can help to lump them into three very broad categories:\n \n Formal communities, such as a college course or professional workplace. Artifacts geared towards these audiences often adhere to highly codified stylistic conventions and are at least somewhat \u201ctight\u201d as a culture.\n Informal communities, such as for friends, family, or social media. Artifacts written for these audiences still follow some rules, but they\u2019re less likely to be explicitly stated. The culture is usually \u201clooser\u201d than academia and professional institutions.\n These communities are defined more carefully below.\n \n Writing within formal communities\n \n When students are expected to simulate expertise on a topic and address a specialized community, they\u2019re writing within a \u201cdiscipline\u201d or \u201cfield of study.\u201d Writing artifacts produced within that field tend to sound the same, circulate within a certain hierarchy, and are housed by specific institutions. The uniqueness of each field of study (a type of context) often fosters academic jargon. You may have noticed that peer-reviewed academic articles look very similar and are more difficult to read than popular news articles. That\u2019s because peer-reviewed articles are published from within and for highly specific writing communities who share a similar vocabulary and disciplinary knowledge with tightly controlled conventions. A contextual appreciation of an article\u2019s audience allows a specialist to say much more about certain things (a molecular biologist can explain the shape of a protein fold very precisely) and less about other things (the same biologist doesn\u2019t need to explain what a protein compound is). Community-as-context helps a writer better understand how to communicate with their intended audience. The cost of this specialization, however, is that peer-reviewed articles can often lapse into too much jargon!\n \n Even when students aren\u2019t expected to simulate expertise, professors often ask them to submit writing samples that adhere to certain conventions, such as MLA or APA Style. In this way, higher education fosters a culture that the cultural psychologist Michele Gelfand would categorize as relatively \u201ctight.\u201d The tightness of academic culture impacts stylistic requirements (MLA, APA, etc.) as well as what \u201cappropriate grammar\u201d looks like.\n \n Part of this tightness helps explain common expectation surrounding \u201cstandard American English\u201d (SAE). Historically, many U.S. academic institutions have penalized deviations from standard English in order to maintain a particular standard that only began to be heavily codified in America in the early nineteenth-century. As a result, variations such as Black English, Spanglish, or sub-dialects related to Southern American English tend to be seen as sub-standard within this broader cultural context that higher education takes for granted (the chapter \u201cStyle and Linguistic Diversity\u201d offers more information about this cultural back-history to standard English). Phrases like \u201cappropriate grammar\u201d should be understood contextually, as belonging to a particular formal culture, even if it\u2019s perceived to be dominant.\n \n Some cultural norms carry over into professional workplace environments, especially formal ones. For example, \u201cclear writing\u201d in the professional world is often conflated with with \u201cIs that written in standard English?\u201d, an expectation that begins in education. On the other hand, MLA or APA formatting are usually not required in many workplace environments, unless it happens to overlap with research or publishing.\n \n Understanding the broader cultural context within which \u201cstylistically appropriate\u201d writing is produced should help a student become even more intentional about the choices they make when writing for the intended audience. It should also lead to more awareness about how to critically evaluate the writing within their community. When participating in peer review, for example, a student who\u2019s aware of the cultural context undergirding requirements such as \u201cappropriate grammar\u201d may adopt a more nuanced tone in their revision feedback.\n \n Writing within informal communities\n \n Depending on a student\u2019s background, the vast quantity of their experience with writing on a daily basis might be for an informal audience, such as a family member, close friends, or significant other. But even very informal writing situations, such as texting a friend, sending an email to a family member, or crafting a social media post place certain expectations on the writer/rhetor. These more informal writing situations may or may not have codes of conduct attached to them. They often appear to emerge spontaneously, as unstated contracts between the parties. Certain unsaid codes of conduct determine what you can and cannot say to a parent vs. a group of friends, for example. However, there tend to be fewer rules governing these situations than the formal writing situations, and they\u2019re usually not articulated anywhere. The rules are almost never explicitly enforced by a governing body or institution. Writers within these situations usually feel spontaneous, natural, and authentic.\n \n The basic distinction between informal and formal writing communities helps explain why college assignments often feel so unnatural and difficult.\n \n IV. Genre\n Genre places additional limits on the rhetor/writer/speaker, beyond those related to the beliefs, concerns, and expectations of the audience.\n \n A genre constraint might be the kind of speech a student is asked to deliver to the class. For example, many COMM 100/101 courses ask students to develop expository and persuasive speeches. When preparing for these assessments, students are often given a set of expectations, including a basic structure, style, and whether certain persuasive appeals are relevant. A student can then adopt a topic of their choice to these default expectations.\n \n This process is not dissimilar from how a maid of honor or best man will google \u201chow to do a maid of honor speech\u201d or \u201chow to do a best man\u2019s speech\u201d before a wedding. There are a well-known set of conventions that people draw from\u2013and, at the same time, cultures and sub-cultures will introduce slight innovations within those recurring forms.\n \n The ability to identify a \u201cpersuasive college speech\u201d or a \u201cbest man\u2019s speech\u201d is both an act of naming and a form of classification. That\u2019s what genre awareness is: an ability to map an assignment or another rhetorical situation to a relatively stable form that recurs across time and space. It\u2019s why the rhetorical term \u201cgenre\u201d is the same as the biological term. They\u2019re both forms of classification. And just as nature evolves, so do li\n[END CHUNK 2/3]\nReply with OK: [CHUNK x/TOTAL], don't reply anything else, don't explain the text!",

How do I fix it?",
    "answer": "The error message you're encountering suggests that the `useSegmentClientContext()` hook is being called without the `SegmentProvider` being present higher in the React tree. However, you mentioned that the `SegmentProvider` is being used inside the `AnalyticsProvider`, and the `AnalyticsProvider` is present in the tree.\n\nThe fact that the error occurs intermittently implies that there might be a race condition or an issue with how the components are being rendered. To address this issue, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1. Ensure that the `SegmentProvider` is being correctly used inside the `AnalyticsProvider`. Verify that the `SegmentProvider` is wrapping the children components, and the `apiKey` and `clientOptions` props are correctly passed.\n2. Double-check if there are any other components or hooks that might be using `useSegmentClientContext()` without being wrapped in the `SegmentProvider`. This might be causing the error in certain situations.\n3. Since the error occurs intermittently, it could be related to how the components are being rendered or updated. Check if there's any conditional rendering logic or if components are being unmounted and remounted under certain circumstances.\n4. To make debugging easier, you can add console log statements or use the React DevTools to inspect the component tree and verify that the `SegmentProvider` is correctly rendered in the tree. This can help you pinpoint any potential issues with the component hierarchy.\n\nIf you're still unable to resolve the issue after following these steps, consider sharing more context about how the components are being rendered, any conditional logic, or other relevant information that might help identify the root cause of the problem.",

We found that the \nmajority of adolescents do not experience any short-term changes in well-being related to their social media use. \nAnd if they do experience any changes, these are more ofen positive than negative. Because only small subsets \nof adolescents experience small to moderate changes in well-being, the true efects of social media reported in \nprevious studies have probably been diluted across heterogeneous samples of individuals that difer in their \nsusceptibility to media efects (also see30). Several scholars have noted that overall efect sizes may mask more \nsubtle individual diferences14, 15, which may explain why previous studies have typically reported small or no \nefects of social media on well-being or indicators of well-being6, 11\u201313. Te current study seems to confrm this \nassumption, by showing that while the overall efect sizes are small at best, the person-specifc efect sizes vary \nconsiderably, from tiny and small to moderate and strong.\nAs called upon by other scholars5, 31, we disentangled the associations of active and passive use of social \nmedia. Research among young adults found that passive (but not active) social media use is associated with lower \nlevels of afective well-being29. In line with these fndings, the current study shows that active and passive use \nyielded diferent associations with adolescents\u2019 afective well-being. Interestingly though, in contrast to previ\u0002ous fndings among adults, our study showed that, on average, passive use of Instagram and WhatsApp seemed \nto enhance rather than decrease adolescents\u2019 well-being. Tis discrepancy in fndings may be attributed to the \nfact that diferent mechanisms might be involved. Verduyn and colleagues29 found that passive use of Facebook \nundermines adults\u2019 well-being by enhancing envy, which may also explain the decreases in well-being found in \nour study among a small group of adolescents. Yet, adolescents who felt better by passively using Instagram and \nWhatsApp, might have felt so because they experienced enjoyment. Afer all, adolescents ofen seek positive \ncontent on social media, such as humorous posts or memes32. Also, research has shown that adolescents mainly \nreceive positive feedback on social media33. Hence, their passive Instagram and WhatsApp use may involve the \nreading of positive feedback, which may explain the increases in well-being.\nOverall, the time spent passively using WhatsApp improved adolescents\u2019 well-being. Tis did not difer from \nadolescent to adolescent. However, the associations of the time spent passively using Instagram with well-being \ndid difer from adolescent to adolescent. Tis discrepancy suggests that not all social media uses yield person\u0002specifc efects on well-being. A possible explanation may be that adolescents\u2019 responses to WhatsApp are more \nhomogenous than those to Instagram. WhatsApp is a more private platform, which is mostly used for one-to\u0002one communication with friends and acquaintances26. Instagram, in contrast, is a more public platform, which \nFigure 1.

In addition, one participant was excluded because no graph could be computed, since \nthis participant\u2019s passive Instagram use was constant across assessments.\n7\nVol.:(0123456789)\nScientific Reports | (2020) 10:10763 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-67727-7\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nallows its users to follow a diverse set of people, ranging from best friends to singers, actors, and infuencers28, \nand to engage in intimate communication as well as self-presentation and social comparison. Such diverse uses \ncould lead to more varied, or even opposing responses, such as envy versus inspiration.\nLimitations and directions for future research. Te current study extends our understanding of dif\u0002ferential susceptibility to media efects, by revealing that the efect of social media use on well-being difers from \nadolescent to adolescent. Te fndings confrm our assumption that among the great majority of adolescents, \nsocial media use is unrelated to well-being, but that among a small subset, social media use is either related \nto decreases or increases in well-being. It must be noted, however, that participants in this study felt relatively \nhappy, overall. Studies with more vulnerable samples, consisting of clinical samples or youth with lower social\u0002emotional well-being may elicit diferent patterns of efects27. Also, the current study focused on afective well\u0002being, operationalized as happiness. It is plausible that social media use relates diferently with other types of \nwell-being, such as cognitive well-being. An important next step is to identify which adolescents are particularly \nsusceptible to experience declines in well-being. It is conceivable, for instance, that the few adolescents who feel \nworse when they use social media are the ones who receive negative feedback on social media33.\nIn addition, future ESM studies into the efects of social media should attempt to include one or more follow\u0002up measures to improve our knowledge of the longer-term infuence of social media use on afective well-being. \nWhile a week-long ESM is very common and applied in most earlier ESM studies34, a week is only a snapshot of \nadolescent development. Research is needed that investigates whether the associations of social media use with \nadolescents\u2019 momentary afective well-being may cumulate into long-lasting consequences. Such investigations \ncould help clarify whether adolescents who feel bad in the short term would experience more negative conse\u0002quences in the long term, and whether adolescents who feel better would be more resistant to developing long\u0002term negative consequences. And while most adolescents do not seem to experience any short-term increases \nor decreases in well-being, more research is needed to investigate whether these adolescents may experience a \nlonger-term impact of social media.\nWhile the use of diferent platforms may be diferently associated with well-being, diferent types of use may \nalso yield diferent efects. Although the current study distinguished between active and passive use of social \nmedia, future research should further diferentiate between diferent activities. For instance, because passive use \nentails many diferent activities, from reading private messages (e.g., WhatsApp messages, direct messages on \nInstagram) to browsing a public feed (e.g., scrolling through posts on Instagram), research is needed that explores \nthe unique efects of passive public use and passive private use. Research that seeks to explore the nuances in \nadolescents\u2019 susceptibility as well as the nuances in their social media use may truly improve our understanding \nof the efects of social media use",

The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing with large (~2GB) inputs. The reallocation logic at `yajl\\_buf.c#L64` may result in the `need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0 when `need` approaches a value of 0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data), which results in a reallocation of buf->alloc into a small heap chunk. These integers are declared as `size\\_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl`, which practically prevents the issue from triggering on 64bit platforms, however this does not preclude this issue triggering on 32bit builds on which `size\\_t` is a 32bit integer. Subsequent population of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the original buffer size, leading to heap memory corruption. This vulnerability mostly impacts process availability. Maintainers believe exploitation for arbitrary code execution is unlikely. A patch is available and anticipated to be part of yajl-ruby version 1.4.2. As a workaround, avoid passing large inputs to YAJL.\n\n2. PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C. Versions 2.12 and prior contain a stack buffer overflow vulnerability that affects PJSUA2 users or users that call the API `pjmedia\\_sdp\\_print(), pjmedia\\_sdp\\_media\\_print()`. Applications that do not use PJSUA2 and do not directly call `pjmedia\\_sdp\\_print()` or `pjmedia\\_sdp\\_media\\_print()` should not be affected. A patch is available on the `master` branch of the `pjsip/pjproject` GitHub repository. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n3. Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.4 has a signed integer overflow in XML\\_GetBuffer, for configurations with a nonzero XML\\_CONTEXT\\_BYTES.\n\n4. swtpm is a libtpms-based TPM emulator with socket, character device, and Linux CUSE interface. Versions prior to 0.5.3, 0.6.2, and 0.7.1 are vulnerable to out-of-bounds read. A specially crafted header of swtpm's state, where the blobheader's hdrsize indicator has an invalid value, may cause an out-of-bounds access when the byte array representing the state of the TPM is accessed. This will likely crash swtpm or prevent it from starting since the state cannot be understood. Users should upgrade to swtpm v0.5.3, v0.6.2, or v0.7.1 to receive a patch. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n5. Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. An attacker can craft a TFLite model that would cause an integer overflow in `TfLiteIntArrayCreate`. The `TfLiteIntArrayGetSizeInBytes` returns an `int` instead of a `size\\_t. An attacker can control model inputs such that `computed\\_size` overflows the size of `int` datatype. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n6. Linux PV device frontends vulnerable to attacks by backends T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Several Linux PV device frontends are using the grant table interfaces for removing access rights of the backends in ways being subject to race conditions, resulting in potential data leaks, data corruption by malicious backends, and denial of service triggered by malicious backends: blkfront, netfront, scsifront and the gntalloc driver are testing whether a grant reference is still in use. If this is not the case, they assume that a following removal of the granted access will always succeed, which is not true in case the backend has mapped the granted page between those two operations. As a result the backend can keep access to the memory page of the guest no matter how the page will be used after the frontend I/O has finished. The xenbus driver has a similar problem, as it doesn't check the success of removing the granted access of a shared ring buffer. blkfront: CVE-2022-23036 netfront: CVE-2022-23037 scsifront: CVE-2022-23038 gntalloc: CVE-2022-23039 xenbus: CVE-2022-23040 blkfront, netfront, scsifront, usbfront, dmabuf, xenbus, 9p, kbdfront, and pvcalls are using a functionality to delay freeing a grant reference until it is no longer in use, but the freeing of the related data page is not synchronized with dropping the granted access. As a result the backend can keep access to the memory page even after it has been freed and then re-used for a different purpose. CVE-2022-23041 netfront will fail a BUG\\_ON() assertion if it fails to revoke access in the rx path. This will result in a Denial of Service (DoS) situation of the guest which can be triggered by the backend. CVE-2022-23042\n\n7. elfspirit is an ELF static analysis and injection framework that parses, manipulates, and camouflages ELF files. When analyzing the ELF file format in versions prior to 1.1, there is an out-of-bounds read bug, which can lead to application crashes or information leakage. By constructing a special format ELF file, the information of any address can be leaked. elfspirit version 1.1 contains a patch for this issue.\n\n8. PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In versions 2.11.1 and prior, parsing an incoming SIP message that contains a malformed multipart can potentially cause out-of-bound read access. This issue affects all PJSIP users that accept SIP multipart. The patch is available as commit in the `master` branch. There are no known workarounds.\n\n9. Flatpak is a Linux application sandboxing and distribution framework. A path traversal vulnerability affects versions of Flatpak prior to 1.12.3 and 1.10.6. flatpak-builder applies `finish-args` last in the build. At this point the build directory will have the full access that is specified in the manifest, so running `flatpak build` against it will gain those permissions. Normally this will not be done, so this is not problem. However, if `--mirror-screenshots-url` is specified, then flatpak-builder will launch `flatpak build --nofilesystem=host appstream-utils mirror-screenshots` after finalization, which can lead to issues even with the `--nofilesystem=host` protection. In normal use, the only issue is that these empty directories can be created wherever the user has write permissions. However, a malicious application could replace the `appstream-util` binary and potentially do something more hostile. This has been resolved in Flatpak 1.12.3 and 1.10.6 by changing the behaviour of `--nofilesystem=home` and `--nofilesystem=host`.\n\n10. A flaw was found in the libvirt nwfilter driver. The virNWFilterObjListNumOfNWFilters method failed to acquire the driver->nwfilters mutex before iterating over virNWFilterObj instances. There was no protection to stop another thread from concurrently modifying the driver->nwfilters object. This flaw allows a malicious, unprivileged user to exploit this issue via libvirt's API virConnectNumOfNWFilters to crash the network filter management daemon (libvirtd/virtnwfilterd).",

    "answer": "The code seems to be implementing a color correction technique that is based on a 3D LUT (Look-Up Table) and Histogram Matching.\n\nThe code looks like it is generally well-structured and uses appropriate functions to break down the main tasks into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.\n\nHere are a few issues I noticed:\n\n1. In `apply_r_curve_transformation`, `apply_g_curve_transformation`, and `apply_b_curve_transformation`, the source images are loaded every time these functions are called. This can be optimized by loading the images only once and passing them as arguments to the functions.\n2. In the same functions, the input and output values of the curve are not being rescaled to [0,1].\n3. In `generate_3d_lut` function, the 'epsilon' argument is never used.\n4. The 'smoothing\\_on' argument in the `generate_3d_lut` function is not used in the code.\n5. The 'sigma' argument in the `generate_3d_lut` function is being used as a scalar in `ndimage.gaussian_filter`, which is not the correct way to apply a Gaussian filter. The correct way would be to use a 2D Gaussian kernel with 'sigma' as the standard deviation.\n6. In `generate_3d_lut` function, the RGB color space is not being normalized (i.e., the values are not being divided by 255) before using it to create the RBF (Radial basis function) interpolator.\n\nHere's how you could make the changes:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport imageio\nimport os\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.interpolate import Rbf\nfrom scipy.interpolate import interp1d\nimport scipy.ndimage as ndimage\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\n\ndef get_images(image_folder):\n    images = []\n    for image_name in os.listdir(image_folder):\n        image_path = os.path.join(image_folder, image_name)\n        with open(image_path, 'rb') as f:\n            images.append(imageio.imread(f))\n    return images\n\ndef get_average_rgb(image_path):\n    image = imageio.imread(image_path)\n    average_rgb = np.mean(image, axis=(0, 1)) / 255\n    return average_rgb\n\ndef get_rgb_coordinates(image_folder):\n    rgb_coordinates = []\n    for image_name in os.listdir(image_folder):\n        image_path = os.path.join(image_folder, image_name)\n        average_rgb = get_average_rgb(image_path)\n        rgb_coordinates.append(average_rgb)\n    return np.array(rgb_coordinates)\n\ndef get_curve_input_output(source_channel, target_channel):\n    source_histogram, _ = np.histogram(source_channel, bins=255, range=(0, 255), density=True)\n    target_histogram, _ = np.histogram(target_channel\n```",

    "prompt": "Convert the following text passage into 30 dot points, keeping in statutes and cases\n\n2 WITNESSES\n \n INTRODUCTION \n\nChapter Two of the uniform evidence law is titled \u2018adducing evidence\u2019. \u2018Adducing\u2019 is an unfortunate instance of jargon in the uniform law. The term is not defined in the statute, but is rather \u2018an umbrella term, used to cover a variety of means by which, and forms in which, evidence may come before a court.\u2019 1 The Evidence Act 2011 (ACT) sensibly replaces the term with \u2018giving or presenting\u2019 evidence, while New Zealand\u2019s Evidence Act 2006 refers to either giving or offering evidence. When they describe what witnesses say in court\u2014the subject of this chapter\u2014all versions of the uniform evidence law use the term \u2018give evidence\u2019. \n\n The hallmark of the \u2018common law trial\u2019\u2014the type of trial held in common law\u2014is that fact-finding is overwhelmingly based on the oral testimony of witnesses in court. This preference for oral testimony\u2014which is not shared by civil law jurisdictions\u2014is based upon some or all of the following beliefs: \n\n\u2022 A person is more likely to tell the truth if he or she testifies on oath, and is subject to the threat of prosecution for perjury proceedings. \n\n\u2022 Any falsehoods or inaccuracies in a person\u2019s account are most likely to be exposed if the person is subjected to cross-examination. \n\n\u2022 The tribunal of fact will be better placed to decide whether or not the person is telling\nthe truth, if the person is in court where his or her demeanour can be assessed. \n\n These beliefs are the basis for hearsay rule (discussed in Chapters 5 and 6). The latter belief was recently relied upon by a NSW judge to refuse to let the plaintiff in a civil claim testify while wearing a niqab: \n\n I must take into account whether I would be impeded in my ability to fully assess the reliability and credibility of the evidence of the fi rst plaintiff if I am not aff orded the opportunity of being able to see her face when she gives evidence. I am well aware that the demeanour of a witness and the viewing of their face is not the only way in which credibility is assessed. In some cases the demeanour of a witness may be misleading. However, neither of those considerations can, in my view, mean that I should be completely deprived of having the assistance of seeing her face to assess her credibility.\n\nUpholding this ruling, the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal noted that the witness was the party to the litigation, wanted to give \u2018strongly contentious\u2019 evidence and seemingly would have refused to testify unveiled even from behind a screen or via CCTV.3\n\nThe preference for oral testimony persists despite contemporary studies that generally show that demeanour is a poor or misleading guide to assessing a witness\u2019s testimony. Even though such studies were accepted by New Zealand\u2019s Law Commission when it drafted that nation\u2019s evidence statute, its Supreme Court had ruled out routinely telling jurors of the pitfalls of using demeanour. Such a warning, it said, would be \u2018inconsistent with important features of the legislative context\u2019, notably this statutory provision:\n\n(1) The ordinary way for a witness to give evidence is,\u2014\n\n(a) in a criminal or civil proceeding, orally in a courtroom in the presence of\u2014\n\n (i) the Judge or, if there is a jury, the Judge and jury; and\n\n(ii) the parties to the proceeding and their counsel; and\n\n(iii) any member of the public who wishes to be present, unless excluded by order of the Judge.4\n\nInstead, the Court devised a broader direction on the many ways that a witness\u2019s testimony can be assessed, combined with the following caution:\n\nI must warn you, though, that simply observing witnesses and watching their demeanour as they give evidence is not a good way to assess the truth or falsity of their evidence. For example, a witness may not appear confident or may hesitate, fidget or look away when giving evidence. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that their evidence is untruthful. The witness may be understandably nervous giving evidence in an unfamiliar environment in front of unknown people. Or there may be cultural reasons for the way a witness presents. On the other hand, a witness may appear confident, open and persuasive but nevertheless be \nuntruthful. And remember that even an honest witness can be mistaken. Things like gestures or tone of voice may sometimes help you to understand what the witness actually means. But you should be cautious about thinking that they will help you much in determining whether or not the witness is telling the truth.5\n\nIn the particular case before it, the Court ruled that a trial judge\u2019s failure to direct jurors about the dangers of demeanour caused no miscarriage of justice in relation to a prosecutor drawing attention to a rape complainant\u2019s expression as she was shown video of a towel that she said was used to restrain her during a rape.\n\nIn Australia\u2014including under the uniform evidence law\u2014the same preference for oral testimony is derived from the common law. In Butera v Director of Public Prosecutions,6 for example, it was justified in the following way:\n\nA witness who gives evidence orally demonstrates, for good or ill, more about his or her credibility than a witness whose evidence is given in documentary form. Oral evidence is public; written evidence may not be. Oral evidence gives to the trial the atmosphere that, though intangible, is often critical to the jury\u2019s estimate of the witness. By generally restricting the jury to consideration of testimonial evidence in its oral form, it is thought that the jury\u2019s discussion of the case in the jury room will be more open, the exchange of views among jurors will be easier, and the legitimate merging of opinions will more easily occur than if the evidence were given in writing or the jurors were each armed with a written transcript of the evidence.7\n\nContemporary legislatures nevertheless recognise the need for exceptions to the principle of orality, as the intimidatingly formal atmosphere of a courtroom may make testifying unduly stressful for some witnesses, and this may affect the quality of their evidence.\n\nAll of the uniform evidence legislation jurisdictions, therefore, make special arrangements for certain classes of witnesses. Typically, these arrangements are available when the witness is a child, is subject to some intellectual disability, or is the complainant in proceedings for an alleged sexual offence. However, the relevant provisions are not contained in the uniform evidence legislation, and the arrangements and the circumstances in which they are available vary in their details from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. A variety of special arrangements can be ordered, including the following:\n\n\u2022 The judge may exclude people from the courtroom while the witness is testifying.8\n\n\u2022 The judge may direct counsel not to robe, or to remain seated while questioning the witness.9\n\n\u2022 The judge may permit the witness to be accompanied by someone who can provide him or her with emotional support while he or she gives evidence.10\n\n\u2022 The judge may order the use of screens to remove the defendant from the witness\u2019s field of vision.11\n\n\u2022 An unrepresented defendant, defending a charge of sexual assault, may not be permitted to cross-examine the complainant.12\n\n\u2022 The witness may be permitted to give his or her evidence from a place other than \nthe courtroom by means of closed-circuit television or \u2018live-link\u2019.13\n\n\u2022 The witness\u2019s evidence may be received in a pre-recorded form. In some jurisdictions, this has now been mandated as the \u2018normal\u2019 method for certain classes of witness to give evidence.14\n\nHowever, two decades after Butera, a majority of the High Court applied that case\u2019s principles to hold that even the most dramatic of alternative practices\u2014the pre-recording of some witnesses\u2019 testimony, an obvious exception to the hearsay rule\u2014does not alter the rules for how such \u2018testimony\u2019 is presented in court. The High Court accordingly held that such recordings are generally to be played once in open court and that the tape should generally never be given to the jury to watch inside the jury room. Only Heydon J disagreed, arguing that the legislature had clearly signalled that the \u2018principle of orality\u2019 comes second to other concerns in such cases.15\n\nThis chapter discusses the means by which evidence is given by witnesses in accordance with the tradition of orality. This is the subject matter of Part 2.1 of the uniform evidence law. The chapter begins with the twin questions of competence and compellability, which between them determine whether or not a particular person will testify. It then discusses how witnesses testify\u2014primarily through answering the parties\u2019 questions\u2014setting out the rules that apply to examination-in-chief, cross-examination and re-examination. Finally, the chapter considers the evidential significance of a party\u2019s failure to call a person as a witness.",
    "answer": "1. Chapter Two of the uniform evidence law is titled \u2018adducing evidence\u2019\n2. \u2018Adducing\u2019 is an instance of jargon in the uniform law\n3. The term is not defined in the statute, but is rather an umbrella term\n4. The Evidence Act 2011 (ACT) replaces the term with \u2018giving or presenting\u2019 evidence\n5. New Zealand\u2019s Evidence Act 2006 refers to either giving or offering evidence\n6. All versions of the uniform evidence law use the term \u2018give evidence\u2019 when they describe what witnesses say in court\n7. The hallmark of the \u2018common law trial\u2019 is that fact-finding is overwhelmingly based on the oral testimony of witnesses in court\n8. This preference for oral testimony is based upon some or all of the following beliefs:\n\t* A person is more likely to tell the truth if he or she testifies on oath\n\t* Any falsehoods or inaccuracies in a person\u2019s account are most likely to be exposed if the person is subjected to cross-examination\n\t* The tribunal of fact will be better placed to decide whether or not the person is telling the truth, if the person is in court where his or her demeanour can be assessed\n9. These beliefs are the basis for the hearsay rule\n10. NSW judge recently refused to let the plaintiff in a civil claim testify while wearing a niqab\n11. Upholding this ruling, the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal noted that the witness was the party to the litigation, wanted to give \u2018strongly contentious\u2019 evidence and seemingly would have refused to testify unveiled even from behind a screen or via CCTV\n12.

    "answer": "Based on the error message you provided, it seems like there is a conflict with the dependency resolution. Using the `--force` flag may not be a good idea since it can override some safety checks and install dependencies with incompatible versions that can break your project.\n\nInstead, you can try using the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag, which instructs npm to install packages even if they have peer dependencies that are not compatible with your current setup. This can sometimes work as a workaround when dealing with conflicting peer dependencies.\n\nSo you can try running the following command:\n```css\nnpm install --legacy-peer-deps\n```\nThis should allow npm to install packages without the conflict errors you have been encountering. However, keep in mind that this might not fix the issue entirely, as the dependencies installed may not work properly together. It is always better to use compatible versions of packages whenever possible to ensure the stability of your project.",

    "answer": "This is a code for a simple 3D raycasting game using the Love2D game engine in the C# programming language. The game generates a random map with some blocks and a player who can move around and look in different directions using the keyboard and mouse. The game uses raycasting to create the illusion of a 3D world.\n\nThe `World` class generates the map and has a method to draw it. It has a 2D array of `TileType` which can be either `Block` or `None`. The `Generate` method sets the edges of the map to `Block` and then generates a random number of `Block` tiles inside the map.\n\nThe `Player` class has properties for its position, size, speed, and angle. The `Draw` method draws a small point at the player's position and prints some debug information on the screen. The `Update` method handles the player's movement by checking the keyboard input and updating the player's position accordingly.\n\nThe `Program` class is the main entry point of the game and inherits from the `Scene` class provided by Love2D. The `Load` method generates the map and creates a new player object. It also sets the mouse to relative mode which allows the player to look around. The `Draw` method draws the map, the player, and calls the `Ray.Draw` method to draw the raycasting lines. The `Update` method updates the player and the rays and checks if the user presses the escape key to quit the game. The `MouseMoved` method updates the player's angle when the user moves the mouse.",

By this definition, any struggle or movement for rights could\nbe conceived as utopian to the extent that it represents a desire to make the world a\n\"better place\" for the (would-be) beneficiaries. The utopianism of rights, and the\nvision of human dignity (and vulnerability ) upon which rights strategies are based, is\ngrounded in modern legal liberalism: rule of law, equality among the subjects of law,\nand universalized application and enforcement within the jurisdiction of law (see\nDworkin, 1977; Donnelly, 1998; for skeptical assessments, see Fitzpatrick, 1992;\nScheingold, 1974).\nThe idea of human rights is undisputedly utopian because it assumes and asserts\nthat all human beings are equal in their humanity. But since humans do not actually\nlive as equals, the idea is also revolutionary because it challenges hierarchies of\npower and privilege upon which political, economic, and social orders around the\nworld are based.\nLouis Henkin (1990) has described the twentieth century as the \"age of rights.\"\nHis intention was not to proclaim a victory for rights, but rather to acknowledge the\ninfluence of the idea of rights on the expectations and struggles of people around the\nworld. Indeed, the right to rights has become an internationalized - if far from\nuniversalized - norm. Abdullahi An-Na'im defines the \"human rights paradigm\" as\n\"the idea that the protection of certain individual and collective/group rights . .. is a\nmatter of international concern, rather than the exclusive internal affair of states\"\n(2001a: 87). According to Richard Wilson: \"Notwithstanding disputes over their\nconceptualization and application, human rights are among the few utopian ideals\nleft, and there is still a remarkable degree of consensus by governments on the\nprinciple at least that certain rights be protected under international law\" (Wilson,\n1997: 1).\nHuman rights are legal entitlements. To understand what human rights \"do\" or\ncan do, it is necessary to appreciate what rights are. Rights can be defined as\npractices that are required, prohibited, or otherwise regulated within the context\nof relationships governed by law. To create new rights requires the creation of new\nlaws, or reinterpretation of existing laws in new ways, or extension of the jurisdic\ntion of laws to new subjects. The process of creating new rights emerges and\nproceeds in response to changing perceptions about social needs and problems,\nwhich, in turn, mobilizes a swell or shift in the balance of politicolegal forces to\nact. The products of that process, new laws that establish new rights (or revise or\nextend existing rights), impose changes by legally regulating relationships and\npractices in new ways. In short, rights are both markers and means of social change.\nThe idea of international human rights had been in circulation for decades prior to\nthe first substantive steps to institutionalize it (see Keck and Sikkink, 1998; Lauren,\n594 L I SA HAJJAR\n1998). One of the leading crusaders for human rights was the prominent British\nutopian writer, H.G. Wells. At the beginning of World War II, Wells wrote:\nAt various crises in the history of our communities, beginning with the Magna Carta,\nand going through various Bills of Rights, Declarations of the Rights of Man and so\nforth, it has been our custom to produce a specific declaration of the broad principles on\nwhich our public and social life is based . . . . The present time seems particularly suitable\nfor such a restatement of the spirit in which we face life in general and the present\ncombat in particular. (cited in Lauren, 1 998: 52)\nIn true utopian fashion, Wells and the many other individuals and groups who\nmobilized and collaborated during the war years strived both to enunciate principles\nof human rights and to advocate their incorporation into the postwar international\norder. While this mobilization replicated and built upon similar activities during\nWorld War I, the failures of those earlier efforts to prevent a second global conflagra\ntion fortified the movement and legitimized their demands for change. For example,\nwhereas in World War I nine out of ten of the millions of casualties were soldiers, in\nWorld War II the proportions of soldier and civilian casualties were roughly even\n(Gutman and Rieff, 1999: 10). In addition to concerns about the harms wrought by\nthe war, rights activists like Mohandas Gandhi and W.E.B. DuBois were animated by\nthe injustices of colonialism and racism. World War II highlighted the linkages\namong these concerns; the politics of race (racial superiority and extermination),\nand the conquest and control of foreign lands were central to Axis war aims, and\nthus became central to the discourse and aims of the Allies' campaign as well. The\nwar against fascism was pitched to the public as a fight for \"freedom\" (e.g., see US\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"Four Freedoms\" speech), and the Allies' victory\nseemed to offer an opening to connect anticolonialism and antiracism to the postwar\nagenda for international legal reform.\nBut in the process that ensued, the utopian vision prioritizing the interests and\nneeds of human beings was overwhelmed by realpolitik. The changes in inter\nnational law after World War II that created human rights did not undermine the\ncentrality of states to political life around the world. Nor did the new international\ninstitutions replace or diminish the authority and power of states over their subjects.\nRather, the creation of human rights entailed the elaboration of new international\nized norms of government to which all states would be expected to adhere, while\npreserving the general principle of states' rights as sovereign entities. Consequently,\nwhile states' rights were revised (e.g., they could no longer claim the \"right\" to\nexterminate civilians), states retained their status as the premier subjects of inter\nnational law. Put simply, human rights obtain their \"universalizing\" character from\nthe fact that people are subjects of states, and states are subjects of international law.\nThus the establishment of human rights simultaneously revised and reinforced the\nstate-centrism of the international order.\nThe most obvious problem with this arrangement was the lack of effective means\nof global governance to ensure law enforcement. Under the state-centric structure of\nthe UN, states were both the governors and the governed - the makers, the enforcers,\nand the subjects of these laws. This meant, for the most part, that the protection and\npromotion of human rights depended on self-enforcement by states. Thus the\navailability of human rights was contingent on the willingness of individual states\nto behave and conform, and dependent on the system of states to act against those\nthat did not (see Falk, 1985).\nHUMAN R I GHTS 595\nWhile some states willingly instituted domestic reforms in keeping with their\ninternational obligations, most refused to regard human rights law as binding and\nenforceable, especially if the implications would compromise vested interests. Obvi\nous examples were resistance by imperial states to relinquish colonial possessions, or\nto dismantle racial or ethnic hierarchies. Unenforceability of international law was\ncompounded by the dynamics of Cold War rivalries between \"East\" and \"West,\" and\nsuperpower competitions for power and influence across the global \"South.\"\nCertainly, the rights of \"self-determination\" and \"equality\" enshrined in the UN\nCharter and the UDHR informed anticolonial and antiracist struggles, but these\nmoral-legal imperatives did not mitigate the difficult and often violent processes of\ndecolonization and desegregation.\nThe human rights idea was further compromised by sharp ideological disagree\nments over the nature of rights and the contested legitimacy of universalism. In the\nUDHR, political and civil rights and social and economic rights were conceived as\n\"indivisible.\" However, Western leaders and leading human rights scholars tended to\nargue that political and civil rights were the priority, or even the only kind of \"real\"\nrights, since social and economic rights could not be guaranteed or enforced without\nviolating the \"freedom\" of the market and the rights to profit and property. Leaders\nof socialist and developing states and scholars committed to those goals tended to\nargue that social and economic rights had to be prioritized to create conditions of\nequality. This would inevitably entail limitations on political and civil rights, and\njustify the use of force in putting down resistance. Socialists challenged the liberal\nlegal emphasis on individual autonomy and freedom, emphasizing alternatively the\nneed for a strong state with a centralized economy capable and committed to\npursuing an agenda to remake the social order by redistributing goods.\nThe other major debate about human rights arose over the meaning and legitim\nacy of \"universalism.\" Specifically, the debate circulates around the changes envi\nsioned and imposed through the establishment of international legal norms. Critics\nof universalism assumed or were given the title of \"cultural relativists.\" Their\narguments were twofold: that human rights enshrined Western values of individual\nism (since individuals were constructed as the \"beneficiaries\" of human rights\nlaw) which contradicted social arrangements and values emphasizing collective\nrelations and mutual duties, and that the imposition of universal standards was a\nnew form of imperialism over non-Western societies (see Pollis and Schwab, 1979;\nRenteln, 1990).",

    "prompt": "A growing body of literature has continuously investigated the relationship between age and traffic accidents. Most research points to significant differences between young adults and older drivers in terms of accident involvement (e.g., Buckley et al., 2014; Chapman et al., 2014; Chung et al., 2014; Chung et al., 2011; Clarke et al., 2006; Gaines et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2006; Park et al., 2009; Stutts et al., 1998; Wood et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2019). High traffic accident rates have been linked to various explanations, such as the greater impulsivity of younger individuals or the decline of cognitive abilities in old age (e.g., Classen et al., 2008; Fraade-Blanar et al., 2018; Hatfield et al., 2017; Lundberg et al., 1998; Miller et al., 2021; Pearson et al., 2013; Wong et al., 2012). Although this approach is one way of preventing hazards on the road, a different approach is needed when targeting professional drivers. \nIn 2020, professional drivers were involved in 19.1% of traffic accidents in the whole South Korea despite that only 7.2% of all registered vehicles are for such professionals to use (MOLIT, 2021). Given the significantly longer time spent on the roads, professional drivers are much more likely to be involved in traffic accidents than non-professional drivers. Moreover, as professional drivers often transport large groups of passengers, the consequences of their accidents can be much more severe. Therefore, it is crucial to comprehensively assess the needs and specifics of professional drivers to reduce the rate of traffic accidents and help prevent road tragedies\nThe biggest difference between professional and non-professional drivers lies in the age distributions. In 2020, young adults (20-39 years old) accounted for 33.8% of all driver's license holders in Korea, middle-aged adults (40-64 years old) made up 54.2%, and seniors (65 years or older) comprised 11.1% (TAAS, 2021). However, only 7.5% of professional drivers were young adults, with the majority - 73.2% - being middle-aged, and 19.3% being seniors (TS, 2021). Unlike the general population, individuals under the age of 40 represent only a very small proportion of professional drivers, highlighting the need to examine professional and non-professional drivers separately. \nThe accident rates for occupational drivers in 2020 were as follows: 68.9% for middle-aged drivers, 26.3% for older drivers, and 4.8% for young adults (TS, 2021). As expected, older drivers had more accidents than predicted by the age distribution. However, the accident rate of middle-aged drivers is still compellingly high, whereas the rate for younger drivers is relatively low. This suggests that research targeting professional drivers should primarily focus on the middle-aged and older groups to decrease the number of traffic accident occurrences. Yet, only a few studies on this topic are currently very available, especially those looking into the effects of cognitive decline with age in both groups. \nAlthough cognitive decline has been linked to unsafe driving regardless of age (Alonso et al., 2016; Bahrampouri et al., 2021; Dawson et al., 2010; Kim, 2014; Mayhew et al., 2006; Zicat et al., 2018), cognitive, visual, and physical abilities are known to deteriorate most significantly as one grows older, making age a critical factor for safe driving. However, research has found only a marginal difference between the driving abilities of young adults and middle-aged drivers, with a sharp decline occurring later in the senior age group (Ledger et al., 2019).\nAccording to the systematic review by Depestele et al. (2020), when considering the relationship between cognitive function and driving behavior, a driver's general cognition, visuospatial perception, attention, memory, and executive function have, for example, been linked to proper lane-keeping (Andrews & Westerman, 2012; Bunce et al., 2012). Similarly, one's overall behavior behind the wheel correlates with attention, processing speed, and memory skills (Ledger et al., 2019; Stinchcombe et al., 2011). For a detailed review, see Depestele et al. (2020).\nWhen age is added to the model, although young and middle-aged adults show significantly better overall driving performance than the elderly, the difference in cognitive functions between the first two age groups remains marginal. Stinchcombe et al. (2011) found only a minimal variation between young and middle-aged driver's performance when looking at their attention and response times, utilizing Useful Field of View, Simple Reaction Time (RT), Choice (RT), and Trail Making tasks. Another study reported no difference between the two age groups on the Cellphone Task, which tests the effect of low to moderately demanding distraction while driving (Reimer et al., 2008).\nFew studies have explored the relationship between cognitive function and driving ability in both middle-aged and older adults (Alonso et al., 2016; Dawson et al., 2010). Dawson et al. (2010) found that older adults exhibited lower performance than middle-aged individuals on all cognitive tasks except the Complex Figure Test (CFT)-Copy and the Structure From Motion tasks when comparing the two age categories, with older drivers making overall 24% more driving safety errors than middle-aged ones.\nThe same study also reported an inverse correlation between safety errors and performance on CFT-Copy, CFT-Recall, Block Design, Near Visual Acuity, and the Grooved Pegboard tasks (Dawson et al., 2010), indicating that among other cognitive skills, visuospatial and visuomotor abilities are crucial predictors of driving performance in older adults. However, since the study mainly focused on senior drivers, it is unclear whether visuomotor abilities would predict safety errors in middle-aged drivers in the same way since the\u00df predicting factors for middle-aged drivers remain unidentified (Dawson et al., 2010). Furthermore, since Dawson et al. (2010) did not find any significant relationship between age and safety errors in the middle-aged group, it is likely that the factors influencing safe driving differ between the two age groups. \nThe purpose of this study was to expand previous research and focus on cognitive abilities predicting safe driving of both middle-aged (40 to 64 years old) and older drivers (65 and above) who account for the majority of professional drivers. So far, only a very few studies examined the cognitive factors predicting safe driving according to driver\u2019s age despite the fact that cognitive ability has already been identified as a critical predictor of safe driving not only in the case of senior drivers. Moreover, in many OECD countries such as the US, UK, Japan, Germany, Denmark, New Zealand, and South Korea, cognitive ability-focused aptitude tests are already being required. This study has the potential to offer further suggestions for such future measures \nOur study specifically targeted cognitive abilities that have shown to possess a strong relationship with safe driving - attention (Ball et al., 1993; Duchek et al., 1998; Hutchinson & Badham, 2013; Kim, et al., 2011; Kwon, 2014; Park et al., 2006; Richardson & Marottoli, 2003; Son & Park, 2013), visuomotor speed (Horswill et al., 2015; Park et al., 2006; Shin & Lee, 2012), visuospatial judgment (Etienne et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2008; Owsley et al., 1999; Verhaeghen et al., 2002), and visual working memory (Lafont et al., 2008; Lim & Lee, 2012; Park et al., 2006; Son & Park, 2013). Previous studies have indicated that attention, visual-related functions, and memory are highly correlated with driving performance and tend to decline significantly with age (Bahrampouri et al., 2021; Depestele et al., 2020; Tarawneh et al., 1993). In addition, since driving is a task that requires the use of multiple cognitive functions in a complex manner, testing each cognitive ability one by one would be insufficient to fully evaluate drivers' real-life performance. Additionally, we chose to assess drivers' multitasking skills by examining their ability to switch between cognitive functions and use more than two at the same time (Wechsler et al., 2018). This allows us to further enrich prior research which has mainly focused only on a limited number of cognitive functions at once or only on drivers' multitasking abilities (Alonso et al., 2016; Bahrampouri et al., 2021; Dawson et al., 2010; Wechsler et al., 2018; Zicat et al., 2018).\nOverall, the results of this study not only allow for a deeper understanding of the relationship between cognitive abilities and safety in middle-aged and older drivers but also have the potential to contribute to the creation of more comprehensive aptitude tests for professional drivers based on their respective age and establish further related interventions. By clarifying which different cognitive abilities decline with age in middle-aged and elderly drivers, this research establishes a solid base for regular driving aptitude testing targeted at the essential cognitive skills of professional drivers. We thus expect to improve the current system and help prevent traffic accidents.\n \n \n \n \uc9c0\uae08 \ubc88\uc5ed\ud558\uae30",

I will give you further instructions after this.\nConstruction & Building Lawyers in Melbourne\nWe are expert building and construction lawyers who provide practical legal advice and representation to:\n\nProperty Owners (including home owners)\nBuilders\nContactors / Sub-Contractors\nProperty developers\nEngineers\nArchitects\nSurveyors\nTradespeople\nBuilding and construction lawyers\nOur Building Legal Services\nCOMMERCIAL BUILDING & CONSTRUCTION\nRESIDENTIAL BUILDING & CONSTRUCTION\nOWNERS CORPORATION\nOur construction and building lawyers in Melbourne have expertise in a wide range of matters relating to the building industry, helping land owners, builders, project managers, and others to avoid running into legal difficulties \u2013 or otherwise resolve them.\n\nWe have practical experience in and around the building industry, which means that our building lawyers understand both the practical side of building issues, in addition, of course, to the legal issues.\n\nNew Building Contracts - Drafting the Contract\nAs a builder or contractor, you may require expert input from a construction lawyer into the legal terms of a domestic or commercial building contract. We can draft the contract for you from the beginning or otherwise adapt an existing contract to cater for a particular job.\n\nContract Review and Negotiation\nDomestic Building Contracts are, even in the standard form, complex documents, whether the contract is for a new home or a renovation. Our building lawyers in Melbourne have advised many clients about their rights and responsibilities under their building contract. There are many \u201ctricky\u201d\u201d parts in these contracts that can cost you a lot of money and time later if not thought through and addressed upfront. In other words, many problems are preventable. We can take you through the terms of your building contract before you sign it \u2013 and help you think through the issues and the legal consequences of agreeing to certain things. If amendments are required, we can also assist you in negotiating special conditions to the contract, to suit your particular circumstances.\n\nContract Termination\nOur building and construction lawyers can assist you in the following circumstances:\n\nWhen you are considering terminating a building contract\nWhen you are being threatened with building contract termination\nWhen you are in a situation where the contract has already been terminated.\nEnding the contract is a serious matter. It should not be done without seeking proper legal advice first.\n\nGenerally, a carefully drafted notice will need to be served before you terminate, so that the other party has an opportunity to fix the problems.\n\nIf the matters are not resolved, and provided there are sufficient grounds \u2013 which must also be thought through carefully \u2013 the contract can then usually be terminated.\n\nTermination by a builder or property owner can be a helpful resolution to a difficult and costly dispute when appropriate. If you terminate incorrectly, this can lead to a very expensive and protracted further dispute. You want to avoid any such dispute where possible.\n\nIf you require advice in relation to such matters, we recommend that you contact a building lawyer promptly before taking further action yourself.\n\nContractual Disputes, Litigation and Dispute Resolution\nWhile disputes are usually unpleasant and time consuming, we assist clients to:\n\nAssert and enforce contractual rights; and\nWhere necessary, assist to contain the damage and present our client\u2019s position in the best possible light.\nContractual disputes can often be resolved sensibly without the need for legal proceedings or mediation. Where possible, our building dispute lawyers will assist clients with that negotiation. If the matter needs to be litigated, we have experience representing clients in all Victorian courts and VCAT.\n\nOur building lawyers in Melbourne take a proactive approach to dispute resolution and prepare thoroughly for mediation and court proceedings.\n\nIf you have a dispute and require legal advice from building dispute lawyers, we recommend that you contact us as soon as possible to seek advice about how best to address the issues and move towards resolving the matter.\n\nWorkplace Health and Safety\nThere is a significant obligation on building companies to address health & safety matters.\n\nOur Melbourne-based construction lawyers provide advice in this complex area, including in relation to code of practice compliance and regulator investigations prosecution issues.\n\nTerms of Trade and Credit Arrangements\nWhether you\u2019re a builder or contractor, and whether you\u2019re providing the service or are the recipient of the service, it is important that you ensure that the terms of trade are helpful to you, and not a potential hindrance.\n\nOur construction lawyers in Melbourne are experienced in both drafting and reviewing terms of trade, including terms that include payment terms and credit arrangements. Getting this right upfront can save confusion and cost and later \u2013 and prevents a dispute later.\n\nIf you are already in dispute and need advice, we can also assist in representing you to resolve the dispute as quickly as possible.\n\nSecurity of Payment Act Claims\nThe point behind the Security of Payments Act legislation is that a party who undertakes construction work is entitled to recover progress payments in relation to the work carried out.\n\nThis is a complex area. When used appropriately, it can be a powerful tool for getting paid, but careful consideration is required as to whether it is the best approach in the circumstances.\n\nA building and construction lawyer can assist you with:\n\nMaking a claim\nApplying for Adjudication\nDefending a claim, including adjudication responses\nApplying to set aside an adjudication determination\nEnforcing an adjudication determination or judgment\nThere are also other methods of debt recovery, and we have experience acting for both plaintiffs and defendants in such circumstances.\n\nBusiness Set Up\nWe regularly provide advice for setting up a new business, including business structures.\n\nWhether you choose to operate as a sole trader company or select a company trust structure can affect your ongoing liability and have taxation consequences.\n\nNeeds also change over time. What might have been suitable when you start business may need to be reviewed as your business grows and changes.\n\nGood legal advice from a construction lawyer will assist you to think through the issues so you can get your building and construction business structure right.\n\nBuying and Selling Real Estate\nAs a builder or developer, if you are involved in buying and selling development sites, you will need to have solid legal advice from a construction lawyer in Melbourne.\n\nWe have property lawyers who can assist in contracts for the sale and purchase of land and, where relevant, commercial and residential leases.\n\nBuilder, Contractor and Sub-contractor Agreements and Disputes\nThe relationship between a contractor and sub-contractor is somewhat unique. It is business to business and you are both in the building industry. Disputes are common and the party who understands its legal position will have the advantage.\n\nOur building dispute lawyers can advise in relation to the following contractor-specific matters:\n\nEmployment advice \u2013 A building lawyer can help determine if the contractor is truly a contractor or an employee and assist with disputes where they arise.\n\nContracts between builders, contractors and subcontractors \u2013 Our construction lawyers in Melbourne can draft and review such contracts and provide advice in the event of a dispute. Where the matter cannot be resolved amicably, our building litigators will represent you very competently.\n\nDisputes between builders, contractors and subcontractors \u2013 If there is a dispute, small disagreements can become expensive disputes quickly. It is sensible to work out the legal issues quickly and try to resolve the dispute. If the other party is not being sensible, a swift and firm approach is usually helpful.\n\nIf you need advice in relation to matters between builders, contractors and sub-contractors, our team of building dispute lawyers can assist you with a high degree of competence.\n\nLicences and Permits\nOur building lawyers in Melbourne can provide advice in relation to the following:\n\nBuilding plumbing, electrical and gas fitting licences \u2013 including application, suspension and appeal\nDevelopment applications\nWater usage\nSewerage/drainage matters\nTree protection (including dealing with planning permit conditions and overlays)\nFire management and fire safety\nExplosives\nAsbestos removal\nPublic land use\nOur building and construction lawyers can assist in the preparation of documentation and representation in relation to all of the above.\n\nBuilding Defects and Home Warranty Insurance Claims\nNot all builders are good builders.\n\nHome warranty claims can be made against builders for defective work.\n\nThe insurance policy cannot be claimed against unless the builder is insolvent, cannot be found or is dead. So, the circumstances are limited.\n\nOur building lawyers have strong experience in helping land owners who have engaged builders and the work is substandard. There are useful remedies available to help get your defects fixed and/or to get you an appropriate amount of compensation.\n\nWe have access to outstanding building experts who can identify the defects (sometimes well beyond what is already known) and ascribe a value to fixing those defects to assist us in properly articulating your claim.\n\nWe will always endeavour to get the dispute resolved without litigation but, if necessary, our building dispute lawyers will prosecute your case with vigour against the builder in VCAT or the courts.\n\nIf you are in dispute with your builder and need legal advice as to how to negotiate with them, or if you would like us to negotiate for you, please contact us.\n\nDebt Recovery\nDebt recovery in building matters is not always clear cut. There can be offsets and counterclaims, so thoughtful consideration of the approach is advantageous.\n\nOur debt recovery team is very experienced and typically successful at recovering outstanding payments.\n\nWe regularly issue letters of demand and commence proceedings to enforce the payment of outstanding debts.\n\nWe will also recommend the Security of Payment approach where appropriate.\n\nWe also defend claim for payment for clients to whom alleged monies are owed.\n\nProject Finance & Finance Documentation Advice\nWe can provide clients with a sound explanation of all finance contracts and personal guarantees in relation to such matters as:\n\nLender contracts from bank and financiers relating to the mortgage of land\nProject funding\nEquipment finance\nThese appointments are usually short and concise. Our building and construction lawyers will ensure that the documentation is explained to you adequately and that the documents are signed correctly.\n\nCall our construction lawyers today on 1300 907 335 to discuss your situation, or simply fill in the enquiry form on this page to receive a prompt response from our construction and building lawyers in Melbourne.",

    "prompt": "Convert the following text passage into 25 dot points, keeping in statutes and cases\n\n2.2.1.2 Reviving memory\n\nGiven the lengthy delays between event and trial, many witnesses have forgotten some or all of the detail of what they witnessed by the time they come to testify. This is especially likely to be true if what was witnessed was simply a routine part of the witness\u2019s life, as, for example, where a doctor is asked to give evidence about a medical examination he or she carried out some time before the trial, or where a police officer gives evidence about the investigation leading up to the charging of the defendant. The prohibition on leading questions in examination-in-chief means that counsel is not permitted to remind the witness of what he or she has forgotten\u2014so how may memory be revived? There are several ways.\n\nFirst, the ban on leading questions does not apply to some categories of evidence. Section 37(2) exempts written documents that are treated as the maker\u2019s evidence in chief, unless the court orders otherwise, while section 37(3) exempts civil witnesses recounting official or public reports. Police recordings of child sexual abuse complainants do not fall outside these exceptions, however, because they are not written (at least, not by the child) and because they are used in criminal trials. The bank employee\u2019s evidence about a credit card application, discussed above, is likewise not exempt because his earlier affidavit was not treated as his evidence and he was exercising commercial, not public or official duties.\n\nSecond, a witness may, with the leave of the court, be permitted to refer to a document in order to revive his or her memory. Section 32(1) provides that \u2018a witness must not, in the course of giving evidence, use a document to try and revive his or her memory about a fact or opinion unless the court gives leave\u2019. In the case of unrepresented defendants who testify, leave should be readily granted to allow defendants to remind themselves of what topics they wish to testify about: Isherwood v Tasmania.60 More generally, section 32(2) provides:\n\nWithout limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give leave, it is to take into account:\n\n(a) whether the witness will be able to recall the fact or opinion adequately without using the document; and\n\n(b) whether so much of the document as the witness proposes to use is, or is a copy of \na document that:\n\n (i) was written or made by the witness when the events recorded in it were fresh in his or her memory; or\n\n(ii) was, at such a time, found by the witness to be accurate.\n\nThese are matters that should be established from the witness concerned through the use of non-leading questions. An example is the following exchange:61\n\nQ. And you spoke to the police at Wollongong, the police station at Wollongong on 17 July 2015, they interviewed you?\n\nA. Yeah.\n\nQ. Do you recall that?\n\nA. I don\u2019t recall it, but I know there is a statement there, yeah.\n\nQ. You spoke to two police officers in an interview that was recorded?\n\nA. Yeah.\n\nQ. Do you recall the last occasion you saw Mark Dower?\n\nA. Nup.\n\nQ. Do you know, did you have any conversations about Mark Dower, with Mark Jenkin, before Mark Jenkin was arrested at some point; did you have some conversation with him about Mark Dower?\n\nA. Well, I can\u2019t remember but I know it\u2019s in the statement, yeah.\n\nQ. What is your memory of, what do you have a memory of, what was said to you by Mark Jenkin about that?\n\nA. Well no, I haven\u2019t. Only what I have read in my statement.\n\nQ. When did you read that last?\n\nA. I read it yesterday.\n\nQ. What can you recall the statement you gave to the police, what did that indicate in relation to your recollection of the conversations between, about between Mr Jenkin, about Mr Dower; what do you recall Mr Jenkin saying?\n\nA. Fuck, I can\u2019t remember what I said.\n\nQ. Sorry?\n\nA. I can\u2019t remember what I said.\n\nQ. Did reading the statement that you made to the police refresh your memory?\n\nA. Well, it did when I read it. You know what I mean. I don\u2019t have a very good memory because I used heaps of drugs.\n\nAs Hamill J observed, the latter answers\u2014the witness\u2019s \u2018insightful self-assessment of the quality of his memory\u2019\u2014established that his memory has been exhausted, while the initial questions showed that there is a document that could be used to revive the memory. However, the exchange did not establish either of the two matters in section 32(2)(b).\n\nIn Director of Public Prosecutions v Asling (Ruling No 7), 62 a key prosecution witness in a murder prosecution gave evidence that deviated from his police statement two years earlier in several respects, including what the accused allegedly said to him after the murder, how many times they spoke, whether he complained about the accused using his car as part of the crime, and what he did with materials left in the car. After refusing to let the prosecutor ask leading questions about these matters under section 37(1)(a), Kaye JA also refused to allow the witness to read the statement to revive his memory, noting that the events described in the statement occurred in 2003, twelve years before the statement was made. Although he conceded that section 32(2)(b)(i) does not say that statements used to revive memory must have been made when the witness\u2019s memory was fresh, he nevertheless thought the time delay was fatal in this case. He added that his view was confirmed by the witness\u2019s concession that, when he spoke to the police, he \u2018was trying to recollect memories from a long time earlier. A lot of memories I tried to forget\u2019 and that he was \u2018under a lot of stress\u2019 when the statement was made. By contrast, Hamill J granted his \u2018insightful\u2019 witness leave to use his earlier statement to \u2018revive\u2019 his memory, noting that his use of the document as an aid would be obvious to the jury, the conversation he recounted was important to the trial and that the context\u2014a murder trial\u2014favoured allowing the witness to try to remember.\n\nIf a witness is permitted to use a document to try and revive his or her memory, he or she may, with the leave of the court, read aloud from that document: section 32(3).63Victoria\u2019s Court of Appeal has observed: \n\nThere is nothing to suggest that this provision is capable of applying only when the attempt to revive memory has been successful. On the contrary, on the plain meaning of the provision all that is required is that the witness should have used the document \u2018to try to revive his or her memory\u2019. This is unsurprising, in our view, as it would be a task of great difficulty for a judge to decide, in any given case, whether what had occurred was an actual \u2018revival\u2019 of an earlier memory or the short-term creation of a fresh memory of the content of the document.64\n\nIn other words, the read-out document will be treated exactly the same as in-court testimony, even if the witness no longer remembers the events described in the document. That means that the contents of the document will still be subject to rules of use, such as the hearsay rule, again in the same way as if the witness simply testified in the document\u2019s terms. In CSR Ltd v Amaca Pty Ltd,65 a medical report, read out in court by the doctor who wrote it years earlier (and obviously could not now recall its details), could be used to find facts that the (now deceased) patients had told the doctor (about whether they had been exposed to asbestos), under a first-hand hearsay exception to the hearsay rule (see Chapter 6: Hearsay Exceptions.) By contrast, Hamill J refused to permit a statement to be read out where, \u2018given the witness\u2019s manifest memory issues, it would not have been fair to allow him to read from an interview which he scarcely remembered making.\u201966\n\nThird, section 33(1) goes even further, recognising the unique position of police officers, by allowing them in criminal proceedings to \u2018give evidence-in-chief for the prosecution by reading or being led through a written statement previously made by the police officer\u2019. Section 33(2) stipulates, among other things, that a written statement can only be used for this purpose if it was made \u2018at the time of or soon after the occurrence of the events to which it refers\u2019. In Salmon v The Queen, 67 it was held that section 33 is not available for police notes made weeks after the events described; section 32 should be used instead. As will be discussed in Chapter 8: Admissions, local rules on confessions generally bar police from reading out notes of admissions supposedly made by a suspect in relation to a serious criminal offence unless those admissions were electronically recorded.\n\nFinally, if the witness chooses instead to attempt to revive his or her memory before coming to court, then there are no limitations on what he or she may use for this purpose. For example, a police officer can read over a statement before she testifies, even if it was written months after the events it describes.68 Certainly, no objection can be taken to a witness being shown a copy of a statement he or she may have made earlier. If counsel becomes aware that the witness has attempted to revive his or her memory in this way, then counsel may call for the production of the document\u2014 again \u2018without penalty\u2019\u2014and production will be ordered.69 Under section 34, failure to produce a document used to revive memory out of court, may result in the witness\u2019s evidence being ruled unusable.",

In Isherwood v Tasmania, leave was readily granted to allow an unrepresented defendant to remind themselves of what topics they wished to testify about.\n19. In Director of Public Prosecutions v Asling (Ruling No 7), Kaye JA refused to allow the witness to read the statement to revive his memory due to a twelve-year time delay.\n20. In CSR Ltd v Amaca Pty Ltd, a medical report read out in court by the doctor who wrote it could be used to find facts under a first-hand hearsay exception.\n21. Section 33 allows police officers to give evidence-in-chief for the prosecution by reading or being led through a written statement previously made by the police officer.\n22. In Salmon v The Queen, section 33 was held not to be available for police notes made weeks after the events described.\n23. Local rules on confessions generally bar police from reading out notes of admissions supposedly made by a suspect in relation to a serious criminal offence.\n24. The witness should attempt to revive their memory before coming to court if they choose to.\n25. Counsel may call for the production of the document if they become aware that the witness has attempted to revive their memory in this way.",

    "prompt": "Among the TOP 20 METATRENDS & MOONSHOTS. I am giving further description for each trend for you consider. first 10 trends is here below 1. Everything is Smart and Embedded with Intelligence\n \nThe price of specialized machine learning chips is dropping rapidly as global demand increases. At the same time, expanding 5G networks coupled with ever-increasing compute on the cloud, means we\u2019re heading towards a future in which all devices in our environment will become intelligent and interactive.Appliances respond to voice command and anticipate your needs. Our environment - lighting levels, music selection, temperature desire - will also respond \u201cautomagically\u201d to your desires. This Metatrend is enabled by the convergence of 5G networks, embedded sensors, IoT/IoE networks, edge-cloud computing, and machine learning systems on the cloud. This Metatrend will impact a multitude of industries from retail, security, health, industrial, transportation networks, education, and home living. \n \n2. AI Will Achieve Human-Level Intelligence\n \nAI algorithms and machine learning tools will be increasingly made open source, available on the cloud, thereby allowing any individual with an internet connection the ability to amplify their creativity, improve their problem-solving skills, and increase their earning capacity. Examples of this include GPT-3 (and soon GPT-4), DALL-E and DALL-E2. This Metatrend will be driven by the convergence of massive amounts of cloud computing, large supply of labeled data, and global high-bandwidth connectivity. Every industry from healthcare, education, and entertainment to design, finance and retail will be significantly impacted.\n \n3. AI-Human Collaboration Will Skyrocket Across All Professions\n \nThe rise of \u201cAI as a Service\u201d (AIaaS) platforms will enable humans to partner with AI in every aspect of their work, at every level, in every industry. AIs will become entrenched in everyday business operations, serving as cognitive collaborators to employees -supporting creative tasks, generating new ideas, and tackling previously untenable innovations. In some fields, partnership with AI will become a requirement. For example, in the future, making certain medical diagnoses without the consultation of AI may be deemed malpractice. Authors will write their blogs, stories, and books in partnership with algorithms like GPT-3 / GPT-4. Artists and designers will use DALLE-2. Software programmers and engineers will partner with AIs to produce code and engineer prototypes.\n \n4. Most Individuals Utilize a \u2018JARVIS-Like\u2019 Software Shell to Improve Their Quality of Life\n \nAs services like Alexa, Google Home, and Apple Homepod increase their capabilities, they will expand to become part of our lives 24/7, serving as our interface with the world around us. Imagine a JARVIS-like \u201csoftware shell\u201d that you give permission to listen to all of your conversations, read your email, and monitor your blood chemistry.\n \nWith access to such data, these AI-enabled-software shells will learn your preferences, anticipate your needs and behavior, shop for you, monitor your health and help solve your problems in support of your goals. \n \n\n \n5. Humanoid Robots & Avatars Are Arriving\n \nFunctional and useful humanoid-robots and avatars will enter daily life this decade. They will look and operate like human beings with legs, arms, fingers and an opposable thumb, allowing them to navigate and interact with the anthropomorphic world around us. \nThese robots are powered by AI and are enabled by the convergence of AI, robotics, sensors, material sciences, high bandwidth communications, and edge computing.\nIn addition to these independent AI-driven robots, there is also a new generation of humanoid avatars that are remotely operated by humans wearing a VR headset and haptic suits. These avatars enable a remote human operator to feel like they are occu- pying the avatar event when operating from hundreds of miles away. These robots and avatars will help fulfill services jobs that are dull, dangerous, or dirty and will enable companies and entrepreneurs to have the labor they require during times of shortage.\n \n \n6. Autonomous Cars & Flying Cars Will Redefine Human Travel (Faster & Cheaper)\n \nFully-autonomous vehicles from Tesla, Waymo (Alphabet) and GM-Cruise (just to name a few) will enable \u201ccar-as-a-service\u201d fleets operating on-demand UBER-like services. Cost of ground transportation will decrease 2x to 4x as a result. Your kids and elderly parents will never drive.\n \nA significant percentage of parking garages, driveways, and parking structures will eventually be transformed into alternative usable space. Autonomous cars will take all shapes and sizes and serve as functional \u201c3rd spaces\u201d used for entertainment, sleeping, or meeting rooms as drive time becomes work or play time. At the same time, aerial ride-sharing, eVTOL (electric Vertical Take-off Or Landing) or flying cars will also become fully operational in most major metropolitan cities this next decade.\n \nWhere you live and work will begin to transform as these systems shrink travel time and thereby distance. Previously difficult to reach geographies (islands, rural areas, mountain tops) will become accessible. Individuals seeking the solitude of the country will also have access to the shopping, food, and entertainment of metropolitan city-centers, connected through eVTOL technology. This meta-trend will be driven by the convergence of machine learning, sensors, materials science, battery storage improvements, and ubiquitous gigabit connections.\n \n7. On-Demand Delivery (& Production) Will Birth an \u201cInstant Economy of Things\u201d\n \nUrban dwellers will learn to expect \u201cinstant fulfillment\u201d of their retail orders as drone and robot last-mile delivery services carry products from local supply depots to your doorstep. This capability, coupled with the deployment of regional on-demand digital manufacturing (3D printing farms), means that even customized \u201cstuff\u201d can be obtained within hours anywhere, anytime.\n \nthis Metatrend will be a critical differentiator for those wishing to promise anything faster and cheaper-the instant economy of things. This Metatrend is driven by the convergence of networks, 3D printing, robotics and artificial intelligence.\n \n8. Global Gigabit Connectivity Will Connect Everyone, Everywhere, Always at Ultra-low Cost\n \nThe deployment of ubiquitous 5G (both licensed and unlicensed) plus the launch of a multitude of global satellite networks (Starlink, OneWeb, Kuiper, etc.) will allow for ubiquitous, low-cost global communications for everyone, everywhere. In the realm of ground-based cellular networks, by 2025 there will be 2.8 billion connected on 5G.\nAt the same time, 6G is also under development, which will be 100x faster. In Earth\u2019s orbit, a number of multi-thousand-satellite systems are being deployed that will ultimately cover every square meter of the Earth. Thus far, Starlink is the largest orbiting network with 2,500+ operational satellites, heading towards a goal of 30,000. This system today offers speeds up to 100 megabits/second. Terrestrial and space-based global connectivity will add an additional 2 billion new minds into the global economy and spur conversations representative of new consumers and creators, who will drive tens of trillions of dollars into the global economy.\n \n9. IoT/IoE - Trillion-Sensor Economy: The Ability to Sense and Know Anything, Anytime, Anywhere\n \nIn addition to connecting human users, the growing terrestrial and satellite communication networks are also enabling the growth of the IoE (the Internet of Everything). Humanity is covering the planet in sensors. Health-related sensors on your body and in your body will be measuring your physiology 24x7. Sensors in your home will listen and watch, providing security and support.\n \nIndustrial sensors will monitor every aspect of the supply chain and manufacturing will optimize production, efficiency and safety. Sensors in autonomous cars will visualize the roads and surroundings through cameras, LIDAR and radar, visualizing all activities in our cities and neighborhoods. Fleets of drones in the sky, and satellite constellations in Earth\u2019s orbit will monitor every square meter of the Earth\u2019s surface. Finally, forward-looking cameras on your AR (augmented reality) headsets will capture a permanent record of our activities and surroundings, what we eat and who we interact with. Today we are birthing a \u201ctrillion sensor economy\u201d in which everything is being monitored, imaged and listened to at all times. This Metatrend\n \nis driven by the convergence of terrestrial, atmospheric, and space-based sensors, combined with machine learning and data networks. In this future, it\u2019s not \u201cwhat you know,\u201d but rather \u201cthe quality of the questions you ask\u201d that will be most important.\n\n10. High-Bandwidth Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI)\n \nTechnologist/futurist Ray Kurzweil predicted that in the early-2030\u2019s we will begin networking the human neo-cortex with the cloud over high-bandwidth connections. Early to medium-term applications will focus on treating a wide range of neurological disorders (e.g. spinal cord injuries), ultimately aiming to restore sensory and movement function for individuals suffering sensory of motor dysfunction.\n \nThe longer-term moonshot vision aims towards non-medical applications that seek\nto create machine interfaces that will attempt to supplement normal human cognitive abilities, with the potential to increase the human sensorium, our memory, and intelligence expanding how we interact with each other and the world. Companies\nlike Neuralink (famously founded by Elon Musk) and Paradromics, utilize micron-scale threads that are inserted into areas of the brain that control movement. Companies like Kernel are building the next generation of brain measurement systems using wearable sensors that offer high-quality neural signal and full-head coverage. OpenWater, a company founded by Dr. Mary Lou Jepsen, is using red-laser holography to read and write onto the surface of neurons. This Metatrend is enabled through the convergence of material sciences, machine learning, and robotics.",

    "prompt": "Please continue writing the article with the upcoming transcript, the first three headings are complete. No need to restate them in your response.\n\nRemember your prompt: Imagine you are a world-class SaaS Sales and Customer Success Enablement and Training AI. \n\nYour Task: You need to produce a wiki article from the transcript of a training session on our new Cross-Workspace Collaboration (XWC) vs our existing Guest User Experience feature. At the end, you will also produce an FAQ, save Question and Answers from each part to a document called \"QnA\".\n\nTo help you create headings for the wiki article I've provided the agenda for the session as a suggestion.\n\nIntroduction (Completed)\nWhy was Cross Workspace Collaboration created? (Completed)\nUnderstanding Guest User Feature (Completed)\nUnderstanding Cross Workspace Collaboration Feature (Discussed in this part)\nKey Differences Between Guest User and Cross Workspace Collaboration Features (Discussed in this part)\nPricing and plans (To be discussed in a later part)\nTips for Suggesting the Right Feature to Customers (May be discussed in this part)\n\nI will provide the transcript in separate parts, here's the sixth part: \n\"00:35:00\nEmily Iba\u00f1ez: Right right. Okay, that makes sense. Thanks.\nSarah Collins: Okay, so this is I'm looping back. This is the portion that I was mentioning. I had an existing note. If you recall And so what happens now is that I get this little modal which tells me that I can slip switch strings to the actual one. That is owned. By my collaborators.\nSarah Collins: So, I can switch between these two.\nJoe Fleming: Yeah, yeah, that's super cool. Yeah. And the UX is pretty nice actually. So, okay, cool. Good to know. So this is as a sidebar, one of the things that we need to do decide as a team is how we use. Do we need to standardize how we use this feature because like, this now opens up the ability to Actually, truly use fellow with our customers. And eat our own dog food, assign them, action items have a mutual action plan with them, but in fellow and it's not a pain for them to be able to collaborate. So like it also it gives our customers a clear reason to come back into the product as well, right? Because they'll come back into the product and they will work on the notes that we have.\nJoe Fleming: Sending them, right. So that I think that that's gonna be super helpful, especially in the POC process and with the multiple assigned, as Marcus said, We can, like assign to all of the people that join a training session and get them to do things. And we'll know, like, whether they've checked it off or not. So we can follow up with those people specifically and we can follow up in their fellow instance, we can assign them, action items directly in their fellow.\nSarah Collins: Yeah, exactly. So this is super powerful, especially because you're gonna have the option to also Have multia signing and crossword stays. So if I was working with a customer, for example, we are onboarding a few people right now and I'm using us for a kickoff note. I can have every single person on that note be assigned to install the desktop and then they're gonna see this inside of their actual fellow account.\nJoe Fleming: Here. Okay.\nSarah Collins: To complete it. So if I now go into my action items here, Install, the Desktop app.\nSarah Collins: oh,\nEmily Iba\u00f1ez: I was doing those sounds when I was on mute.\nSarah Collins: What?\nJoe Fleming: Yeah, exactly. And there's a nice little progress bar. It's awesome. Just I want to make sure that we have time for both questions. And I think the big question like the big thing though to touch on and I'm very keen to get your take on the Sarah is What? Cuz, like, the use cases are the use cases for crossword space and for guests basically the same. I guess that's one question. Are there any additional use cases and\nJoe Fleming: aside from that, like, Is there any case where like people shouldn't choose the guest experience over the crossword space experience?\nSarah Collins: Great question. So there's a few differentiations between the two and really it comes back to what the capacity that you're working with this person in. So I would use crossword space in onboarding here at fellow and onboarding customers because it's going to be for a prolonged period of time. So in that case, if I was choose the guest experience, their access is going to expire and their existing fellow users, so they're not going to see any of their action items in their own work space, which in the past has meant that those action items. Never get looked at again because you have to log into that separate fellow workspace in order to view them. So the time that you want to use crossword space is if the guest either has an existing fellow account or they are willing to open up a fellow account and connect their calendar, if they're willing to do those two things. Cross workspace is a much better experience.\nSarah Collins: But if it's kind of like a one-time access scenario, and they're just meeting that one time. They don't plan on meeting again in the future, but for whatever reason they need collaboration for that one meeting. In that case, I would recommend guest if there's security issues because explaining to someone who doesn't know and or understand fellow, even from new customers that we're on board. Their number one, fear is, What are you doing with my calendar Information? That fear prevents a lot of people from actually sending up to fellow to begin with because they don't understand why we need access to that information because they haven't hit their aha moment yet. So if that fear is really prevalent, then guest users is a really good option. Otherwise collaborate collaborative access through crossword space. It's overall in my opinion, a much smaller experience and it removes. A lot of that friction that you would tend to find with just the regular guest experience.\n00:40:00\nSarah Collins: Like, the access link expiring and all that stuff.\nSarah Collins: I heard some questions, feel free that pop in and ask them.\nSarah Collins: Yeah, exactly.\nJoe Fleming: Yeah, I would default. I would be fob to crossword space. Pretty much all the time even if it's short term. because at the end of the day, like, I think the the other way to look at it is every, every crossword space is an opportunity for another lead. For us. So it's better\u2026\nSarah Collins: Yeah. I agree.\nJoe Fleming: if they use even if they don't continue to use it, the other thing is is like keep in mind. For like our end internally. every single time somebody connects their calendar, it means that Like, we can find out. if this person or any other person, that logs in, if they have a ton of meetings, recurring meetings in their calendar, it means we know like, hey,\nJoe Fleming: This person will really care about this tool. Maybe we should like whether it's us as a sales, team manually going after these people and saying, Hey like you're in meetings all the time. You know, here's an opportunity to make your meetings better or if it's like through the product or some other way. Like every single calendar, connect helps us continue to grow our base and target people. That actually are experiencing. The problem that we solve. So I think this is why it's so important is because like the you know, building the database of users is a big part of building the business, so cool. So I think that like covers, most of the things here in terms of pricing in plans,\nSarah Collins: The four-way move on to that Joe. Can I just munch one last thing? Onboarding experience for crossword space is a little bit different.\nJoe Fleming: Yeah, of course.\nSarah Collins: We're optimizing to get them right into that meeting that they are going to be collaborating with that other company. So they're not getting, that usual onboarding flow and that's important to mention because they're a ha moment is gonna come from that collaborative access. And then they explore everything else that fellow has to offer after the fact.\nSarah Collins: Yes. Question.\nEmily Iba\u00f1ez: Yeah. Yeah, I said a question. So you mentioned so like if I have a pro plan and I'm sharing my note with Joe, but Joe's on free in two weeks. Once Joe loses access to his note history, does that mean he also won't, he won't be able to see like our past notes. But I will. because,\nSarah Collins: That's a great question. And I can't remember what product told me for that one.\nEmily Iba\u00f1ez: Okay, no worries. Just because like, I'm envisioning it being like me saying, Hey Joe, like look at our note from three weeks ago, and then Joe's, like Why can't I see it? But you can't see it, right? So,\nSarah Collins: Yeah, that's a great question. I'm like, 50%. Sure that they told me that for cross works. Basic collaboration notes that you do retain the access because it's technically owned by the workspace that is upgraded. But we should definitely talk with product on that\u2026\nEmily Iba\u00f1ez: Right.\nSarah Collins: because I'm not a hundred percent sure.\nEmily Iba\u00f1ez: It would also be a good paywall though maybe to upgrade the free person, then they feel like they're missing out on the notes, right? So,\nSarah Collins: All the fellow. Yeah.\nSarah Collins: Awesome. Okay. Sorry Joe. What was your next question there?\"",
    "answer": "Understanding Cross Workspace Collaboration Feature\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nCross Workspace Collaboration (XWC) allows users from different workspaces to collaborate on notes and tasks more effectively than the Guest User feature. With XWC, users can switch between their own workspace and the one shared by their collaborators. This enables better collaboration, as customers can work on notes directly in the product, making it especially useful during the POC process. XWC also supports multi-assigning, allowing multiple users to be assigned to a task and track its progress.\n\nKey Differences Between Guest User and Cross Workspace Collaboration Features\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Duration of collaboration: XWC is recommended for long-term collaborations, such as onboarding processes, while the Guest User feature is more suitable for one-time or short-term access scenarios.\n2. Fellow account requirement: XWC works best when the guest user has an existing Fellow account or is willing to create one and connect their calendar. In contrast, the Guest User feature is ideal when the guest does not have a Fellow account or is not willing to connect their calendar.\n3. Access expiration: With the Guest User feature, access to shared information may expire, while XWC does not have such limitations.\n4. Onboarding experience: For XWC, the onboarding experience is optimized to get users directly into the meeting they are collaborating on, without the usual onboarding flow.\n\nTips for Suggesting the Right Feature to Customers\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Choose XWC for long-term collaboration or when the guest user has a Fellow account and is willing to connect their calendar.\n2. Opt for the Guest User feature in cases of one-time access, short-term collaborations, or when there are security concerns related to calendar access.\n3. When considering the customer's plan, note that the access to past notes for free users in XWC may depend on the upgraded workspace's ownership. Consult with the product team for clarification if needed.\n\nFAQ - QnA\n---------\n\nQ: Once a free user loses access to their note history, will they lose access to past shared notes in XWC?\nA: It is believed that users retain access to shared notes in XWC because the upgraded workspace technically owns them. However, it's essential to consult with the product team for confirmation, as this detail is not 100% certain.",

    "prompt": "Yeah, 2000 I was trying to get to this next level, but you know, the parts that are made\n in China are not subject to a tariff, so that's certainly helpful.\n We also save on logistics and generally we found that locally sourced parts in China\n cost less than in the US or Europe.\n So this is all pretty helpful.\n So Tesla got added to the purchase tax exemption, which all the other...\n I'm not sure if you'll realize just how much of an off-field battle Tesla's had to sell\n cars in China.\n It's been a really...\n And basically no access to any of the subsidies and we paid a tariff and we had to ship the\n cars over.\n And every single thing was set against Tesla and still we made progress and did decently\n well.\n So I think that there will be much better situation with local production, not having\n to do shipping and tariffs and being able to have lower cost, local sourcing of components.\n So it would make a big difference I think.\n Is that your victory dance?\n When you broke ran into that?\n Yeah, that's great.\n It's a big deal.\n Huge.\n Yeah, just...\n It's just fundamental economics.\n It kind of makes sense that making cars on the continent where there are boards will\n be a lot more efficient than making them in California and chipping them around the world.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n And you can get paid for the cars before paying your suppliers, which seems to not be the\n case if you're shipping around the world.\n Right.\n And it's like friction on the whole kind of cash flow situation or it has been.\n For sure.\n It will sure make a big difference on cash flow because yeah, there's just no way to\n get the cars, especially to Europe, but we're even trying to get them to customers before\n we have to pay suppliers.\n So if you're a rapidly growing company, it's nine day if you get paid by your customers\n before you have to pay your suppliers, like night and day.\n Because in the faster you grow, the video cash position is.\n But if it's the other way around where you have to pay your suppliers before you get paid\n by customers, then the faster you grow, the faster your cash position drops.\n Yes, you're up, yes.\n Because you spend more money to make your own.\n Yes, it's a growth actually causes you to over into the ground in a situation like that.\n Now it tells you we had a mixture of both things where we had a lot of customers in\n say in California.\n And that's fast.\n For sure, we would get paid by customers faster than we'd have to pay suppliers.\n But then for cars going to Europe and Asia, it's the other way around.\n So we would have to pay suppliers before we got paid by customers.\n And now we could offset some of that with the asset back line, which was pretty helpful,\n but only some of it, not all of it.\n So the fundamental financial health for sure improves dramatically by just having a factory\n on the continent.\n We're not talking next door, but it's just how many ocean, especially Europe was logistically\n super hard because we're on the West Coast.\n If we're on the East Coast, then China would be much harder.\n But if you're on the West Coast, you're from the charter because you've got to go to the\n Panama Canal or even worse around Tierra del Fuego.\n Because sometimes the Panama Canal get backed up and you're like, \"This friggin' ship is\n going to the Antarctic.\"\n It's like you could skip up to the end and it stole me as hell.\n It's just so you could just send a ship around chilling.\n Are you kidding?\n In the middle of crazy storms and then back up all the way and then it is too funny.\n Oh my God.\n So let me just take nightmare.\n So yeah, it'd be great to just have it not get on a boat.\n It crossed the Pacific and Atlantic and that kind of thing.\n So maybe similar to Vincent's question, what's the biggest advantage in choosing Berlin\n compared to other European countries?\n Berlin has the best nightclubs.\n That's true.\n How many bit?\n I went to Brooklyn once.\n Really?\n Yeah.\n Holy shit.\n That's cool.\n Yeah, it was a few years ago.\n Well, I don't know.\n I mean, he looked at a lot of different locations and I don't know.\n We could have put him in a lot of locations.\n We needed to move quickly and actually this place, it's like 30 minutes to the outskirts\n of Berlin, technically in Brandenburg.\n It actually was a place location that BMW was going to put a plant there.\n So a ton of the environmental work and all of the permits and stuff had already been\n done.\n And then for some reason, BMW chose a different location.\n But there's like, I guess, something on the order of a year's worth of environmental paperwork\n and stuff that's been done on that location for an auto plant.\n So that's one of the quickest places to get going.\n And generally, the government, local and state government was very supportive.\n So I went there and it's like, OK, this seems like some pretty good vibes this place.\n So this is a lovely part of this lovely place.\n And there's an opportunity for-- it's close enough to Berlin that say young people could\n still live in an apartment in Berlin and commute to the factory.\n It's right, there's a train station.\n They actually can move the train station.\n It's a small train station.\n But they're going to move the train station to where you can literally get off the train\n and be right at the gig of Berlin.\n Wow.\n That's great.\n That's great.\n It could literally just pop right off and walk very unadvisable.\n So then it's like, OK, this is pretty cool.\n And so young people could be in Berlin, apartment, and it's a little quirky here in Berlin.\n But if you want to have more of a family situation, the backyard is affordable, housing available\n with houses with yards and stuff that aren't too expensive.\n Yeah.\n So it seems like a good combination of factors.\n Yeah, a lot of talent in the area.\n So it sounds cool to Google in.\n It just sounds like some cool nightclub, I think.\n You could definitely have a cool nightclub that was cool, but yeah, it sounds good.\n It sounds pretty cool.\n It's pretty fun.\n It's a party gig-ish.\n Yeah.\n It's sort of like a rave cave in the...\n There's a lot of space around the factory side.\n But you should have your own nightclub.\n Yeah.\n I think that would be...\n Who doesn't know what to do?\n I don't know if he doesn't know what to do with that.\n I feel like I'd go for sure a work at a company that's got the nightclub.\n That sounds way more fun.\n Didn't you want to put a roller coaster into the Fremont factory?\n Yeah.\n You're still going to do that?\n I mean, I think that would be pretty fun to do.\n Yeah.\n I think we can just do...\n Yeah, just basically have like...\n We just needed a rail that can support like a modified Tesla's.\n And then...\n Oh my God.\n Can you imagine a plaid flat?\n Yeah, just like zip around.\n Around the factory in like five seconds.\n Yours would be booked for months.\n Yeah, we should get it right now.\n Awesome.\n Yeah, we're kind of actually in various parts of the factory, we have vehicle conveyance\n systems.\n They just don't move that fast.\n But they're kind of like roller coasters that move slowly.\n You can speed up.\n Yeah, you can speed up.\n Exactly.\n So, yeah.\n But yeah, we're all from feeling pretty...\n You know, we're not a tent fade or anything, but feeling pretty good about where things\n are headed.\n And I think this is a lot of good things.\n You know, Model Y coming out this year.\n And some exciting announcements about batteries.\n A lot of progress in autopilot.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n So, pulling, giga-balloon.\n And then making progress in some of the new vehicle developments.\n And solo the solar roof, solar glass roof.\n Getting that rolled out.\n The Cybertruck got received really well, I think.\n Yeah.\n Did you expect that many orders?\n No, not really.\n It's amazing.\n When I first saw the Cybertruck in France's design studio, I mean, you know, it had told\n me that this was a daring design.\n Although, I think you're the most excited about this design than any design.\n Yeah, I thought it would be the best product ever.\n Yeah.\n And I saw it.\n I was just taken aback.\n And not by the design so much, by the pure aggression that the truck, you stand in front\n of it and you're like, \"Okay, I'm afraid.\"\n You know, it really is like a badass truck.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n Well, it seems like a lot of reasons why people buy pickup trucks in the US is like,\n because it's like the most badass truck.\n You know, like, which one is the toughest truck?\n And it's like, what's tougher than a truck?\n A tank.\n That's a good one.\n Like a tank

    "prompt": "Give me the TL;DR for this article: In 2016, a blockbuster drug called Humira was poised to become a lot less valuable.\n\nThe key patent on the best-selling anti-inflammatory medication, used to treat conditions like arthritis, was expiring at the end of the year. Regulators had blessed a rival version of the drug, and more copycats were close behind. The onset of competition seemed likely to push down the medication\u2019s $50,000-a-year list price.\n\nInstead, the opposite happened.\n\nThrough its savvy but legal exploitation of the U.S. patent system, Humira\u2019s manufacturer, AbbVie, blocked competitors from entering the market. For the next six years, the drug\u2019s price kept rising. Today, Humira is the most lucrative franchise in pharmaceutical history.\n\nNext week, the curtain is expected to come down on a monopoly that has generated $114 billion in revenue for AbbVie just since the end of 2016. The knockoff drug that regulators authorized more than six years ago, Amgen\u2019s Amjevita, will come to market in the United States, and as many as nine more Humira competitors will follow this year from pharmaceutical giants including Pfizer. Prices are likely to tumble.\n\nThe reason that it has taken so long to get to this point is a case study in how drug companies artificially prop up prices on their best-selling drugs.\n\nAbbVie orchestrated the delay by building a formidable wall of intellectual property protection and suing would-be competitors before settling with them to delay their product launches until this year.\n\nThe strategy has been a gold mine for AbbVie, at the expense of patients and taxpayers.\n\nOver the past 20 years, AbbVie and its former parent company increased Humira\u2019s price about 30 times, most recently by 8 percent this month. Since the end of 2016, the drug\u2019s list price has gone up 60 percent to over $80,000 a year, according to SSR Health, a research firm.\n\nOne analysis found that Medicare, which in 2020 covered the cost of Humira for 42,000 patients, spent $2.2 billion more on the drug from 2016 to 2019 than it would have if competitors had been allowed to start selling their drugs promptly. In interviews, patients said they either had to forgo treatment or were planning to delay their retirement in the face of enormous out-of-pocket costs for Humira.\n\nAbbVie did not invent these patent-prolonging strategies; companies like Bristol Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca have deployed similar tactics to maximize profits on drugs for the treatment of cancer, anxiety and heartburn. But AbbVie\u2019s success with Humira stands out even in an industry adept at manipulating the U.S. intellectual-property regime.\n\n\u201cHumira is the poster child for many of the biggest concerns with the pharmaceutical industry,\u201d said Rachel Sachs, a drug pricing expert at Washington University in St. Louis. \u201cAbbVie and Humira showed other companies what it was possible to do.\u201d\n\nFollowing AbbVie\u2019s footsteps, Amgen has piled up patents for its anti-inflammatory drug Enbrel, delaying a copycat version by an expected 13 years after it won regulatory approval. Merck and its partners have sought 180 patents, by one count, related to its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda, and the company is working on a new formulation that could extend its monopoly further.\n\nHumira has earned $208 billion globally since it was first approved in 2002 to ease the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. It has since been authorized to treat more autoimmune conditions, including Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. Patients administer it themselves, typically every week or two, injecting it with a pen or syringe. In 2021, sales of Humira accounted for more than a third of AbbVie\u2019s total revenue.\n\nAn AbbVie spokesman declined to comment. The company\u2019s lawyers have previously said it is acting within the parameters of the U.S. patent system. Federal courts have upheld the legality of AbbVie\u2019s patent strategy with Humira, though lawmakers and regulators over the years have proposed changes to the U.S. patent system to discourage such tactics.\n\nIn 2010, the Affordable Care Act created a pathway for the approval of so-called biosimilars, which are competitors to complex biologic drugs like Humira that are made inside living cells. Unlike generic equivalents of traditional synthetic medications, biosimilars usually are not identical to their branded counterparts and cannot be swapped out by a pharmacist.\n\nThe hope was that biosimilars would drastically drive down the cost of pricey brand-name biologics. That is what has happened in Europe. But it has not worked out that way in the United States.\n\nPatents are good for 20 years after an application is filed. Because they protect patent holders\u2019 right to profit off their inventions, they are supposed to incentivize the expensive risk-taking that sometimes yields breakthrough innovations. But drug companies have turned patents into weapons to thwart competition.\n\nAbbVie and its affiliates have applied for 311 patents, of which 165 have been granted, related to Humira, according to the Initiative for Medicines, Access and Knowledge, which tracks drug patents. A vast majority were filed after Humira was on the market.\n\nSome of Humira\u2019s patents covered innovations that benefited patients, like a formulation of the drug that reduced the pain from injections. But many of them simply elaborated on previous patents.\n\nFor example, an early Humira patent, which expired in 2016, claimed that the drug could treat a condition known as ankylosing spondylitis, a type of arthritis that causes inflammation in the joints, among other diseases. In 2014, AbbVie applied for another patent for a method of treating ankylosing spondylitis with a specific dosing of 40 milligrams of Humira. The application was approved, adding 11 years of patent protection beyond 2016.\n\nThe patent strategy for Humira was designed to \u201cmake it more difficult for a biosimilar to follow behind,\u201d Bill Chase, an AbbVie executive, said at a conference in 2014.\n\nAbbVie has been aggressive about suing rivals that have tried to introduce biosimilar versions of Humira. In 2016, with Amgen\u2019s copycat product on the verge of winning regulatory approval, AbbVie sued Amgen, alleging that it was violating 10 of its patents. Amgen argued that most of AbbVie\u2019s patents were invalid, but the two sides reached a settlement in which Amgen agreed not to begin selling its drug until 2023.\n\nOver the next five years, AbbVie reached similar settlements with nine other manufacturers seeking to launch their own versions of Humira. All of them agreed to delay their market entry until 2023.\n\nSome Medicare patients have been suffering as a result.\n\nSue Lee, 80, of Crestwood, Ky., had been taking Humira for years to prevent painful sores caused by a chronic skin condition known as psoriasis. Her employer\u2019s insurance plan had helped keep her annual payments to $60. Then she retired. Under Medicare rules, she would have to pay about $8,000 a year, which she could not afford.\n\n\u201cI cried a long time,\u201d she said.\n\nFor months, Ms. Lee stopped taking any medication. The sores \u201ccame back with a vengeance,\u201d she said. She joined a clinical trial to temporarily get access to another medication. Now she is relying on free samples of another drug provided by her doctor. She doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019ll do if that supply runs out.\n\nBarb Teron, a book buyer in Brook Park, Ohio, plans to delay her retirement because she is worried about Humira\u2019s cost. Ms. Teron, who takes Humira for Crohn\u2019s disease and colitis, has never had to pay more than $5 for a refill of the drug because her employer\u2019s insurance plan picks up most of the tab. The cost, according to a pharmacy app on Ms. Teron\u2019s phone, was $88,766 in the past year.\n\nMs. Teron, who turns 64 in March, would have liked to retire next year, but that would have meant relying on Medicare. She fears that her out-of-pocket costs will spiral higher. \u201cWhen I look at that $88,000 charge for a year, there\u2019s no way,\u201d Ms. Teron said.\n\nAbbVie executives have acknowledged that Medicare patients often pay much more than privately insured people, but they said the blame lay with Medicare. In 2021 testimony to a congressional committee investigating drug prices, AbbVie\u2019s chief executive, Richard Gonzalez, said the average Medicare patient had to pay $5,800 out of pocket annually. (AbbVie declined to provide updated figures.) He said AbbVie provided the drug for virtually nothing to nearly 40 percent of Medicare patients.\n\nThe drug\u2019s high price is also taxing employers.\n\nSoon after she started taking Humira, Melissa Andersen, an occupational therapist from Camdenton, Mo., got a call from a human resources representative at her company. The company directly covers its employees\u2019 health claims, rather than paying premiums to an insurer. Her Humira was costing the company well over $70,000 a year \u2014 more than Ms. Andersen\u2019s salary.\n\nThe H.R. employee asked if Ms. Andersen would be willing to obtain the drug in an unconventional way to save money. She said yes.\n\nAs soon as March, her company plans to fly Ms. Andersen, 48, to the Bahamas, so that a doctor can prescribe her a four-month supply of Humira that she can pick up at a pharmacy there. Humira is much cheaper in the Bahamas, where the industry has less influence than in it does in Washington and the government proactively controls drug pricing.\n\nIt is not yet clear how much the knockoff products will cost and how quickly patients will switch over to them. Billions of dollars in drug spending will ride on the answers to those questions.\n\n\u201cWe price our products according to the value they deliver,\u201d said Jessica Akopyan, a spokeswoman for Amgen, whose biosimilar product comes to market on Tuesday. She added that the company would \u201cemploy flexible pricing approaches to ensure patient access.\u201d\n\nEven now, as AbbVie prepares for competitors to erode its Humira sales in the United States, the company will have a new way to make more money from the drug. Under the terms of the legal settlements it reached with rival manufacturers from 2017 to 2022, AbbVie will earn royalties from the knockoff products that it delayed.\n\nThe exact sizes of the royalties are confidential, but analysts have estimated that they could be 10 percent of net sales. That could translate to tens of millions of dollars annually for AbbVie.\n\nIn the longer run, though, AbbVie\u2019s success with Humira may boomerang on the drug industry.\n\nLast year, the company\u2019s tactics became a rallying cry for federal lawmakers as they successfully pushed for Medicare to have greater control over the price of widely used drugs that, like Humira, have been on the market for many years but still lack competition.2 / 2",

    "answer": "I apologize for the error you are experiencing. The \"KeyError: 'external\\_url'\" message indicates that the `external_url` key is not present in one of the dictionaries in the `css` property of the `app` object. This is usually caused by an issue with the `app.css.append_css` method.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can try the following:\n\n1. Make sure that you have passed a dictionary to the `app.css.append_css` method that has the `external_url` key and its corresponding value. The `external_url` key should contain the URL of the external stylesheet that you want to include in your app. For example:\n```\napp.css.append_css({\n    'external_url': 'https://codepen.io/chriddyp/pen/bWLwgP.css'\n})\n```\n1. If you want to define the CSS styles inline, you can use the `css` key instead of the `external_url` key. The `css` key should contain a string with the CSS styles that you want to include in your app. For example:\n```\napp.css.append_css({\n    'css': 'body { background-color: #111111; }'\n})\n```\n1. If you are using the `dash-bootstrap-components` library, you can set the `dark` theme to `True` to set the background color of the app layout to a dark color:\n```\napp = dash.Dash(external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.DARKLY])\n```\nI hope these suggestions help. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you need more help.",

Following this structure:\n\"HISTORICAL EVENT/STORY/ EXPERIENCE THAT ILLUSTRATE THE TITLE OF THE CHAPTER OF SUBCHAPTER \nQUOTE\nSCRIPTURE \nMY STORY \nCALL TO ACTION\"\n\nRevise and improve the chapter:\n\"Chapter 1-Get Your House in Order \n\nNormal is getting dressed in clothes that you buy for work, driving through traffic in a car that you are still paying for, in order to get to a job that you need so you can pay for the clothes, car and the house that you leave empty all day in order to afford to live in it. \n\nEllen Goodman\n\nSCRIPTURE \nMatthew 7:5\n International Version\nYou hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother\u2019s eye\nStory\nGardner was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on February 9, 1954, to Thomas Turner and Bettye Jean Gardner. He was the second child and the only boy born to Bettye Jean. His older half-sister, Ophelia, is from a previous union. His younger sisters, Sharon and Kimberly, are children from his mother's marriage to Freddie Triplett.\nGardner did not have many positive male role models as a child, as his father was living in Louisiana during his birth, and his stepfather was physically abusive to both his mother and his sisters. Triplett's fits of rage made both Gardner and his sisters constantly afraid.[1] In one incident, Bettye Jean was imprisoned when Triplett falsely reported her to the authorities for welfare fraud; the children were placed in foster care. When Gardner was eight years old, he and his sisters returned to foster care for the second time when their mother, unbeknownst to them, was convicted of trying to kill Triplett by burning down the house while he was inside.[1][2]\nWhile in foster care, Gardner first became acquainted with his three maternal uncles: Archibald, Willie, and Henry. Of the three, Henry had the most profound influence on him, entering Gardner's world at a time when he most needed a positive father figure. However, Henry drowned in the Mississippi River when Chris was nine years old.[3] The children learned that their mother had been imprisoned when she arrived at Henry's funeral escorted by a prison guard.[2]\nDespite both her very unhappy marriage and her periods of absence, Bettye Jean was a positive source of inspiration and strength to her son Chris. She encouraged Gardner to believe in himself and sowed the seeds of self-reliance in him. Gardner quotes her as saying, \"You can only depend on yourself. The cavalry ain't coming.\"[4]Gardner also determined from his early experiences that alcoholism, domestic abuse, child abuse, illiteracy, fear, and powerlessness were all things he wanted to avoid in the future.[1]\nEarly adulthood[edit]\nInspired by his Uncle Henry's worldwide adventures in the U.S. Navy, Gardner decided to enlist when he finished secondary schooling. He was stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina for four years, where he was assigned as a hospital corpsman. He became acquainted with a decorated San Francisco cardiac surgeon, Dr. Robert Ellis, who offered Gardner a position assisting him with innovative clinical research at the University of California Medical Center and Veterans Administration Hospital in San Francisco. Gardner accepted the position, and moved to San Francisco upon his discharge from the Navy in 1974. Over the course of two years, he learned how to manage a laboratory and to perform various surgical techniques. By 1976, he had been given full responsibility over a laboratory and had co-authored several articles with Dr. Ellis that were published in medical journals.[3]\nMarriage and struggles[edit]\nOn June 18, 1977, Chris Gardner married Sherry Dyson, a Virginia native and an educational expert in mathematics. With his knowledge, experience, and contacts within the medical field, it appeared Gardner had his medical career plans laid out before him. However, with ten years of medical training ahead of him and with changes in health care just on the horizon, he realized that the medical profession would be vastly different by the time he could practice medicine. Gardner was advised to consider more lucrative career options; a few days before his 26th birthday, he informed his wife, Sherry, of his plans to abandon his dreams of becoming a physician.[3]\nHis relationship with Sherry was detached, in part because of his decision to abandon a medical career and in part due to differences in their behavior. While still living with Sherry, he began an affair with a dental student named Jackie Medina, and she became pregnant with his child only a few months into the affair. After three years of marriage to Sherry, he left her to move in with Jackie and to prepare for fatherhood. Nine years elapsed before he and Sherry were legally divorced in 1986.[3]\nHis son Christopher Jarrett Gardner Jr. was born on January 28, 1981. Gardner worked as a research lab assistant at UCSF and at the Veterans' Hospital after leaving the service. His position as a research lab assistant paid only about $8,000 a year, which was not enough for him to support a live-in girlfriend and a child. After four years, he quit these jobs and doubled his salary by taking a job as a medical equipment salesman.[5]\nPrompted by his son's inquiries about his father, Gardner had previously been able to track down his biological father via telephone. With a higher income from his new job, Gardner was able to save enough money to travel to Monroe, Louisiana, where he and his son met his father, Turner, for the first time.[3]\nGardner returned to San Francisco determined to succeed at business. A pivotal moment in his life occurred, after a sales call to a San Francisco General Hospital when he encountered an impeccably dressed man in a red Ferrari. Curious, Gardner asked the man about his career. The man told him he was a stockbroker and, from that moment on, Gardner's career path was decided.[4] Eventually, Gardner bought a Ferrari of his own from Michael Jordan.[1] The Illinois license plate of Gardner's black Ferrari reads \"NOT MJ\".\nThe stockbroker in the red Ferrari was a man named Bob Bridges. He met with Gardner and gave him an introduction to the world of finance. Bridges organized meetings between Gardner and branch managers at the major stock brokerage firms that offered training programs\u2014such as Merrill Lynch, Paine Webber, E.F. Hutton, Dean Witter Reynolds, and Smith Barney. For the following two months, Gardner canceled or postponed his sales appointments, and his car amassed parking tickets while he met with managers.[3]\nIt appeared that Gardner got his \"break\" when he was accepted into a training program at E.F. Hutton. He subsequently quit his sales job so that he could dedicate his time exclusively to training as a stockbroker. Then he appeared at the office ready to work, only to discover that his hiring manager had been fired the week before. To make matters worse, Gardner's relationship with Jackie was falling apart. According to Gardner, the police witnessed an incident in which Jackie was running away with Chris Jr. and Gardner attempted to take the child back, but in the process swung Jackie into the garden bushes, which resulted in her being scratched. Gardner was apprehended initially for this incident, but an identity check on his car license plate led them to detain him for non-payment of parking fines.[6][better source needed] He was taken to jail and a judge ordered that he stay there, for ten days, as punishment for being unable to pay $1,200 in parking tickets.[7] Jackie then took Chris Jr. away to live with her on the East Coast, but she eventually decided not to press charges over the incident.[8][better source needed]\nGardner returned home from jail to find his apartment empty. With no experience, no college education, virtually no connections, and with the same casual outfit he had been wearing on the day he was taken into custody, Gardner gained a position in Dean Witter Reynolds' stock brokerage training program. However, this offered no salary; apart from selling medical equipment that brought in 300\u2013400 dollars a month in the early 1980s, and with no savings, he was unable to meet his living expenses.[3]\nFatherhood and homelessness[edit]\nGardner worked to become a top trainee at Dean Witter Reynolds. He arrived at the office early and stayed late each day, persistently making calls to prospective clients with his goal being 200 calls per day. His perseverance paid off when, in 1982, Gardner passed his Series 7 Exam on the first try and became a full employee of the firm. Eventually, Gardner was recruited by Bear Stearns & Company in San Francisco.\nAbout four months after Jackie disappeared with their son, she returned and left him with Gardner. By then, he was earning a small salary and was able to afford rooming in a flophouse. He willingly accepted sole custody of his child; however, the rooming house where he lived did not allow children. Although he was gainfully employed, Gardner and his son secretly struggled with homelessness while he saved money for a rental house in Berkeley.\nMeanwhile, none of Gardner's co-workers knew that he and his son were homeless in the Tenderloin District of San Francisco for nearly a year. Gardner often scrambled to place his child in daycare, stood in soup kitchens and slept wherever he and his son could find safety\u2014in his office after hours, at flophouses, motels, parks, airports, on public transport, and even in a locked bathroom at a BART station.[9]\nConcerned for Chris Jr.'s well-being, Gardner asked Reverend Cecil Williams to allow them to stay at the Glide Memorial United Methodist Church's shelter for homeless women, now known as The Cecil Williams Glide Community House. Williams agreed without hesitation.[3] Today, when asked what he remembers about being homeless, Christopher Gardner Jr. recalls \"I couldn't tell you that we were homeless, I just knew that we were always having to go. So, if anything, I remember us just moving, always moving.\"\nAfter Gardner had found a home, he resumed contact with Jackie and had a second child with her in 1985 \u2013 a daughter named Jacintha.[10][better source needed] Gardner turned down Jackie's offer for the two to get back together in a relationship, but arranged for Chris Jr. and Jacintha to stay with Jackie during his long hours at work.[10]\n\nRead more: https://www.searchquotes.com/search/Keep\\_Your\\_House\\_In\\_Order/#ixzz7elLjykBa\n\nChris Garner\u2019s story in a great American story about despair and triumph.

Born to an abusive stepfather and an incarcerated mother, Gardner's early life was marked by foster care and uncertainty. However, despite these challenges, his mother's words of encouragement and belief in him helped him develop the resilience and self-reliance he needed to succeed.\n\nInspired by his uncle's adventures in the U.S. Navy, Gardner enlisted and became a hospital corpsman. After leaving the Navy, he secured a position assisting a cardiac surgeon in San Francisco. He later realized that the medical profession was changing and that his dream of becoming a physician was no longer viable. He made the difficult decision to abandon his medical career and begin anew.\n\nGardner's personal life was also tumultuous. He left his wife to move in with his mistress, who was pregnant with his child. With a low-paying job and a growing family to support, he made the decision to become a medical equipment salesman, which doubled his salary and gave him the financial stability he needed.\n\nCall to Action:\nLike Gardner, we all have our own unique struggles and challenges.

    "prompt": "Can you please write a conclusion for a chapter I wrote called How to do market research for a small business. Include key takeaways. Here is the text: Chapter 2 - Conducting Market Research\nBefore you launch your business, it's important to do your market research. Without it, you are flying blind and may very well fail.\nIt could be that there is no market for your product or service or that the market is saturated. And even if there is a market, you still need to know who your target audience is, what they want, and how to reach them.\nBy performing market research, you can avoid some pitfalls and give your business the best chance for success.\nIn this chapter, we will discuss the basics of market research and how to go about doing it for your business idea. Let's dive right in!\nWhat is Market Research?\nMarket research involves collecting and analyzing data about consumers and the market to make better marketing and business decisions. It is essential to understand what people want, how much they are willing to pay, and what factors influence their purchasing decisions. \nWhen done correctly, market research can be extremely helpful in making decisions about product development, pricing, advertising, and other marketing strategies. For instance, it can help answer questions like: What do consumers want? What are they willing to pay for it? How often do they purchase it? What factors influence their purchasing decisions?\nTherefore, if you have a great business idea but are unsure if there is a market for it or how to reach consumers, market research can be invaluable.\nMarket Research Methods\nThere are two main types of market research: primary and secondary. By using these methods to conduct your market research, you get to better understand your target market and the needs or wants they have.\nPrimary and secondary market research utilizes quantitative and qualitative methodologies.\nQuantitative research methods involve using numbers and statistical analysis to understand customer behavior. This type of market research is often used to understand large groups of people or to predict future industry trends.\nWith qualitative research methods, the researchers use more open-ended questions to understand customer motivations and behaviors. This type of market research is effective when we want to gain a deeper understanding of a smaller group of people.\n1. Primary Market Research:\nPrimary research involves collecting data directly from original sources. It is also sometimes called field research or empirical research. \nThis type of research is usually conducted to address a specific problem or fill existing knowledge gaps. \nThere are many ways to collect primary data, but some of the most common methods include surveys, interviews, focus groups, and observations. When conducting primary research, it is important to be as detailed and accurate as possible to obtain accurate results.\nA significant advantage of primary research is that it allows researchers to collect data directly from people rather than relying on what others have already reported. Thus, it helps to ensure that the data are accurate and relevant. \n2. Secondary Research:\nSecondary research is a research method that relies on already existing data. It is a type of research that has already been compiled, gathered, organized, and published by someone else. \nSecondary research can be a more efficient use of time and resources than primary research since it relies on existing data. There are three major sources where this data can be found: \n(i) Commercial sources: Commercial sources are produced by companies specializing in collecting and selling research data. Examples of commercial sources include market reports, industry reports, and data from demographic surveys. \n(ii) Government sources: Government sources are produced by government agencies. These can be national, state/province, or local government agencies. Examples of government sources include census data, economic data, and health data.\n(iii) Internal sources: Internal sources refer to data already within your company. This could include customer data, sales data, and employee data. \nNow, let's focus on the different types of market research you should conduct for your business idea.\nTypes of Market Research for a Business Idea \nThere are various types of market research entrepreneurs or aspiring business owners can use to determine whether their business idea is feasible. The following outlines four common types of market research:\n1. Interviews\nInterviews are a great way to gather in-depth information about your target market. You can interview current or potential customers and experts in your industry. This type of market research will give you insights into your customers' needs and buying habits.\n2. Surveys\nA survey is an excellent way to collect data from many people. You can use online surveys to reach a wide audience or conduct in-person surveys. Surveys are a great way to gather information about your target market's demographics, buying habits, and needs and wants.\n3. Focus Groups\nIn a focus group, a group of people are brought together to discuss a particular topic. The participants are usually asked to give opinions on a product, service, or business idea. Once the discussion is complete, the moderator will compile the results and share them with the client.\n4. Competitive Analysis Research\nCompetitive analysis research involves studying your competition to see what they are doing well and where they can improve. This type of research can help you find ways to differentiate your business from your competitors.\nTo conduct a competitive analysis, you can start by searching for your competitors online. Next, look at their websites and social media accounts to see what they are saying and doing. You can also look for customer reviews of their businesses. After gathering this information, you can start formulating your business strategy.\n5. Pricing Research\nPricing research is a type of market research that involves assessing what prices your competition is charging for its products or services. In addition to looking at your competition's prices, you will also want to consider your target market's willingness to pay for your product or service. To conduct pricing research, you can start by looking at your competition's websites, talking to industry experts, or conducting surveys.\n6. Product/Service Research\nProduct/service research involves assessing the feasibility of your business idea. This type of research is important because it will help you determine if your product or service is something people want or need. Also, it will help you determine if there is a market for your product or service. To conduct product/service research, you can start by surveying your target market to see if they would be interested in your product or service. You can also research your competitors to see what they are offering and how they are marketing their products or services. \n7. Customer Research\nCustomer research involves understanding your target market. With this type of research, you can determine who your target market is and what they want or need. To conduct this research, you can start by surveying your target market to see what they are looking for in a product or service. You can also research your competitors to see whom they are targeting and how they are marketing to them.\nHow to conduct market research Step by Step\nThe market research process is an important step in developing your business idea. This section will provide an overview of the steps involved in conducting market research.\nStep 1. Identify your target market\nBefore you can even think of conducting market research, you need to know who your target market is. Your target market is the group of people who are most likely to buy your product or use your service. To get an idea of who your target market might be, you can consider asking some questions like:\n-What needs does my product or service address?\n-Who would benefit most from using my product or service?\n-What age group is my product or service most applicable to?\n-What gender does my product or service appeal to most?\n-What income bracket does my product or service most appeal to?\nStep 2. Identify your competitors\nNext, you need to identify your competitors. Doing so will help you understand what your target market is already exposed to and what you'll need to do to stand out. The best way to do this is to search for them online and take note of their marketing strategies, pricing, target audience, etc.\nBy understanding your competition, you can adjust your marketing strategy accordingly and target a specific audience that your competitors may be missing.\nStep 3. Set your research goals\nNow, you can begin to set your research goals. These goals will help guide your research and ensure that it is focused. Some goals you might want to set include:\n-What are the needs of my target market?\n-What are the buying habits of my target market?\n-How much are my target customers willing to spend on my product or service?\n-What are the main concerns of my target market when it comes to my product or service?\n-How does my target market currently access products or services like mine?\nStep 4. Decide on your research methods\nYou can use various research methods to collect data about your target market. Some common methods include surveys, interviews, focus groups, and questionnaires. However, before you decide on a research method, you'll need to consider a few factors, including the number of people you need to reach, the amount of time you have, and your budget.\nStep 5. Collect your data\nAfter you've decided on your research methods, it's time to start collecting data. This data will be used to help you answer your research questions and achieve your goals. You will use the methods you decided on in Step 4 to collect this data.\nStep 6. Analyze your data\nAt this point, you will have a lot of data to sift through. It's important to take the time to analyze your findings carefully to glean valuable insights from them.\nThere are various ways in which you can analyze your data. For instance, you can look for trends, compare groups, or examine relationships.\nOnce you have your data, you can start by sorting it into different categories. This will make it easier to analyze. For example, if you're looking at the buying habits of your target market, you might want to sort your data by age group, income bracket, or gender.\nNext, you can look for trends such as patterns in your data. For instance, if you notice that a certain age group is more likely to buy your product than another age group, you can start to target your marketing efforts toward that age group.\nYou can easily identify emerging trends or patterns by generating graphs, charts, and other visual representations of your data.\nSome tools you can use to help you analyze your data include Excel, Google Sheets, and Tableau.\nStep 7. Summarize your findings\nEspecially if you are using your research for a formal business plan, once you've analyzed your data, you'll need to compile your research and insights into a cohesive report.\nWhen presenting your findings, include a summary of your research goals, research methods, and key findings. You should also include any recommendations for further action.\nYour report should be clear, concise, and easy to understand. It should also be visually appealing, with charts, graphs, and other visuals to help illustrate your points.\nStep 8. Use your research to make decisions\nNow that you've presented your findings, it's time to start using your research to make decisions for your business idea. For example, deciding which target market to focus on and the price point you will set for your product.\nRemember, your research is only as good as the decisions you make with it. So, be sure to use it wisely!",

This form is prepared for the purpose of section 175B of the Workers Compensation Act 1987, Schedule\n2 Part 5 Payroll Tax Act 2007 and section 127 of the Industrial Relation Act 1996. If this form is\ncompleted in accordance with these provisions, a principal contractor is relieved of liability for workers\ncompensation premiums, payroll tax and remuneration payable by the subcontractor.\nA principal contractor can be generally defined to include any person who has entered into a contract\nfor the carrying out of work by another person (or other legal entity called the subcontractor) and\nwhere employees of the subcontractor are engaged in carrying out the work which is in connection with\nthe principal contractor\u2019s business.\n2. For the purpose of this Subcontractor\u2019s Statement, a principal contractor is a person (or other legal\nentity), who has entered into a contract with another person (or other legal entity) referred to as the\nsubcontractor, and employees/workers of that subcontractor will perform the work under contract. The\nwork must be connected to the business undertaking of the principal contractor.\n3. Provide the unique contract number, title, or other information that identifies the contract.\n4. In order to meet the requirements of s127 Industrial Relations Act 1996, a statement in relation to\nremuneration must state the period to which the statement relates. For sequential Statements ensure\nthat the dates provide continuous coverage.\nSection 127(6) of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 defines remuneration \u2018as remuneration or other\namounts payable to relevant employees by legislation, or under an industrial instrument, in connection\nwith work done by the employees.\u2019\nSection 127(11) of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 states \u2018to avoid doubt, this section extends to a\nprincipal contractor who is the owner or occupier of a building for the carrying out of work in\nconnection with the building so long as the building is owned or occupied by the principal contractor in\nconnection with a business undertaking of the principal contractor.\u2019\n5. Provide the date of the most recent payment claim.\n6. For Workers Compensation purposes an exempt employer is an employer who pays less than $7500\nannually, who does not employ an apprentice or trainee and is not a member of a group.\n7. In completing the Subcontractor\u2019s Statement, a subcontractor declares that workers compensation\ninsurance premiums payable up to and including the date(s) on the Statement have been paid, and all\npremiums owing during the term of the contract will be paid.\n8. In completing the Subcontractor\u2019s Statement, a subcontractor declares that all remuneration payable to\nrelevant employees for work under the contract has been paid.\n9. In completing the Subcontractor\u2019s Statement, a subcontractor declares that all payroll tax payable\nrelating to the work undertaken has been paid.\n10. It is important to note that a business could be both a subcontractor and a principal contractor, if a\nbusiness \u2018in turn\u2019 engages subcontractors to carry out the work.

In their experiment, a pair of electrodes were immersed in a liquid dielectric. As the potential difference is applied to the electrodes, the dielectric between the electrodes increases.

This force only exists in the\n59 fringing field, where the intensity of the electric field\n60 varies rapidly. The third term is the electrostrictive force,\n \n\n2.6 Pressure equation\n \n3 The pressure equation comes from momentum equation\n4 by substituting the following Equation (50) into the\n5 momentum equation. The pressure equation gives as\n \n\n \n30 where t is the thickness of the dielectric layer, \u03c3 is the\n31 gas-to-liquid interfacial tension, \u03b5r is the permittivity of\n32 free space, \u03b5 is its relative dielectric constant and V is the\n33 applied voltage. \u03b80 is the contact angle without applied\n34 voltage.\n35\n36 The limitation of the Young-Lippmann\u2019s equation is that\n37 the static contact angle vs. applied voltage can be\n38 described by assuming the errors associated with the\n39 uniform-surface-charge are small. Therefore, the\n40 following two assumptions are made for Equation (52).\n41 First, contact angle hysteresis cannot be predicted from\n42 static electrowetting. Secondly, the uniform-charge\n43 assumption is quite inaccurate at the triple point. Thus\n44 Equation (52) gives a good qualitative description of the\n45 contact angle changes with voltage but is insufficient to\nquantitatively predict droplet motion. In order to validate\nwith the Young-Lippmann\u2019s equation, we applied\n47 Equation (33) to solve for the electrophoretic force. Due\n48 to the assumptions in Young-Lippmann\u2019s equation, the\n49 dielectrophoretic and electrostrictive force are negligible.\n50 Then Equation (21) is used to calculate the electric\n51 charge density. The computational setup and boundary\n52 conditions can be found in Figure 10. The parameters are\n53 listed in Table 5.\n54\n \n\nFigure 10 Schematic of the eletrowetting model\n\nFigure 11 shows our preliminary results of the shape of bubbles at different voltages. The potential contour in the bubble varies greatly because the bubble has a smaller electric conductivity than DI water. The contour lines are densely concentrated near the bubble angle, which indicates the internal force along the two-phase interface. The arrow indicates the direction of electric force. Obviously, this force pushes the interface inward and changes the apparent contact angle. According to the Young-Lippmann\u2019s equation, the final contact angle is 84\u00ba and it correlates well with the simulation result at 200V.\n \n55 Table 5 Parameters in the electrowetting model \n56 Properties Water Dielectric layer Air \n \nFigure 11 Evolution of bubble shapes\n\nFigure 12 shows the velocity vectors at different time steps. The red color region on the figure shows the\n \n1\n2\n3 maximum velocity and the blue color region shows\n4 minimum velocity. At the initial stage, the velocity\n5 vector starts from the corner of the bubble due to the\n6 electrical force and forms a circulation in the interior\n7 bubble. When V=0V (t=0.01s in Figure 12), the vapor\n8 bubble has an obtuse contact angle (~103\u00b0) after the\n9 hydrophobic surface is stabilized. When t=0.02s, the\n10 bottom of the bubble begins to recoil due to the reduction\n11 of the apparent contact angle. The sudden contraction of\n12 the bubble produces a disturbance, which propagates\n13 upward from t=0.02s to 0.03s along the bubble surface in\n14 the form of capillary waves. In this capillary driven flow,\n15 there is a clockwise flow at the interior of the bubble and\n16 a counter-clockwise flow at the exterior of the bubble.\n17 The circular fluid motion that originates from around the\n18 triple contact point drive the recoiling of bubble. Until\n19 t=0.04s, the contact angle reaches to its final stage. The\nlarge clockwise recirculation flow at the interior of\nbubble becomes a counter-clockwise recirculation flow.\n21 However, a small clockwise circulation flow still exists\n22 at the triple contact point. The size of clockwise\n23 circulation flow at the triple contact point decreases from\n24 t=0.01s to 0.04s. This peripheral circular motion near the\n25 interior of the bubble triple contact point drives the\n26 bubble base to recoil until the circulation flow is strong\n27 enough to split up the bubble.\n51 t=0.03s t=0.04s\n52 Figure 12 Velocity vectors at different time steps\n53\n54\n55 3.2 Validation with experimental results\n56\n57 A classical case of the EWOD driven droplet detachment\n58 has been discussed in [45]. In order to validate with\n59 experiment, we conducted a similar simulation case of\n60 droplet detachment with the reference.

my listeners know who you are and what you do so if you could just fill everybody in on who you are what you're all about and what you do that would be a great place for us to start today okay so i'm a medical doctor um this is my third career in medicine uh i started as a pediatrician i was an infectious disease specialist\n00:49\ni was an emergency doctor and now i have a very large natural medicine clinic in clearwater florida i've been doing this for 23 years started with my wife originally she's a nurse and we really specialize in people with unsolved medical problems so our average patient has seen 13 doctors lyme cancer central nervous system disease autoimmune disease things like that about 20 years ago i started a nutrition company which is called body health and we make really very high quality nutritional products uh my hobbies are iron man i've done 43\n01:31\nof them uh you're in coeur d'alene so i've done coeur d'alene i think twice maybe three times that iron man um so i'm active i love what i do and um i'm excited to be here and talk to you i'm excited to have you now fill my listeners in a little bit on this iron man stuff and you said you've had three medical careers how old are you dr minkoff 782 and you're still an active um engaged athlete at this age yeah i i mean the first i scheduled uh four races for the spring of course they\n02:09\nwere all cancelled i'm supposed to do a half iron man the end of september uh it's still on and then i'm doing an ironman in november and so far it's still up so we'll just what happens i'm training is it's gonna it was as if it's gonna happen i love that talk about inspirational when people say they are too old to do something uh they just need to come and look at your stuff yeah i mean age is a is is if you know i see people every day who say well i'm 60 now and i should retire and\n02:42\ni'm old and i can't do it and really i think at 60 you should be smarter than you were when you were 40 you know more you're probably financially better off than you were you could make a bigger impact uh you can help more people and so i just don't see that anything other than what i'm doing would be very much fun and and so i just i love this my my uh office manager's been with me for eight 18 years and a couple years ago she's probably just 50.\n03:11\nso a couple of years ago she said to me like i'm not retiring till i'm at least 65 and that means you're not retiring either so um that's good with that's good for me and you're helping so many people so that's got to be another i mean you can't go anywhere yet because i think you have unfinished business now right definitely do definitely do so i so appreciate that so what got you moving kind of out of a more traditional medical career into more of what you do now where you're a little\n03:45\ntaking a little bit more of a holistic i guess approach to things yeah well i was i was working in the emergency room it was a chest pain centers and it's one of the top 100 hospitals in the united states and we would see you know people with heart attacks and strokes and broken legs and gunshot wounds is pretty much all-purpose uh community hospital emergency room and my wife is a nurse and she's also a triathlete and she was very interested in health like before i was i wasn't interested in health\n04:16\nfrom a performance standpoint for myself but in terms of uh sort of as a career or anything like that i it was i wasn't interested or i didn't know about it so one of the first things that she did was she started reading about mercury and mercury is put into the silver fillings in people's teeth so when they make an amount it's called an amalgam because an amalgam is a group of metals that are all bonded together so a standard amalgam filling which is it's about 50 mercury which is liquid you know\n04:47\nprobably all everybody's probably played with mercury we've seen mercury in a thermometer so it's it's 50 mercury and then if you add copper tin silver you get an amalgam and they put that in teeth mercury at room temperature is liquid it boils at about 110 degrees so if you heat it up if you have a hot cup of coffee or soup or tea which might be 140 or 150 degrees when it hits that mercury some of that mercury is going to boil it's going to come off you're going to swallow it you're going\n05:19\nto inhale it and it's going to come into your body there's lots of experiments with sheep where they put fillings in and and then they would put a label on the on the mercury so they could track where it went in the body and then they'd just have the sheep do its normal life in a couple months they would then sacrifice the sheep and look to see where did the mercury go and they would find it in the brain in the kidney and the adrenal glands of the lung and the heart it goes places so anyway she learned about this and she\n05:46\ndecided that she should get the mercury taken out of her teeth now there is a safe way to do this but this is back in like 1995 1996 there were very few dentists who knew about it and the dentist that she went to didn't know about it and he took his high speed drill and he drilled out 14 mercury fillings and within about six or eight weeks she started to become ill her thyroid started to hurt and then her liver started to hurt and then so i i was in the emergency room i knew all the good doctors i had them uh see her\n06:22\nand what they decided was that she had some kind of an autoimmune condition where her immune system was actually attacking her and it was attacking her thyroid it's a common condition called hashimoto's thyroiditis and her liver enzymes were inflamed and they tested her for viruses and ultrasounds and all this stuff and they didn't they didn't find anything so um then after that one morning she wakes up and she has weakness of her arm she's having trouble brushing her teeth and she has weakness of her glute muscle\n06:50\non the same side and so she saw a neurologist and they thought well maybe this condition is ms or something like that and they wanted to put her on very strong toxic medicines like prednisone it's a steroid and interferon and at that point we were both like we got to find a better answer to this so we started looking around and then she's a nurse and she has a business which uh sends people uh home health care so they send people in people's houses to dressing changes and baths and helping them take\n07:25\nthe medicine and her office was then the office next was vacant and so a dentist moved in there and on the marquee it said natural dentistry and one day i was driving to pick her up he was walking out of his office and he and i stopped him and introduced myself and i said what's natural dentistry and he said well most dentists have the idea or the belief or an education that your mouth isn't really part of your body that it's a separate thing and that you could do things in the mouth that you would never do in the rest of\n07:59\nthe body like you'd never put mercury in someone's arm they don't even put mercury on a wound now the old medicine mercurical is pretty much banned there used to be mercury in in contact lens solution but it's toxic and so a regular doctor would never utilize that kind of material so he said that's how we think so we're trying to do things in the mouth that are complementary to the body not harmful to the body so i said oh that makes sense so i said listen to the story and i told him a story about my wife\n08:31\nand without a hesitation he said she's mercury toxic but there's nobody in this town that's going to help you there is a doctor in seattle he does training courses for doctors you should go there you should learn about this and then come back and see if what i'm saying is true so i did that i went to seattle i spent a bunch of time with him i learned his methodology and i came back and i tested her and she was mercury toxic and so he had a protocol to detoxify people i did that protocol and within four or\n09:02\nfive months she was fine her liver was fine her thyroid's fine all of her weakness went away so we had friends who were sort of watching this whole thing go on and they came up to me and said well i have rheumatoid arthritis or i've got chronic migraine headaches or i've got ulcerative colitis can you help me and at the time i wasn't very confident about what i knew like i had a case success of one and so i'm in the emergency room it's shift work you know it's like seven in the morning or seven at night or seven at\n09:33\nnight seven in the morning three or four days a week and i had some off days and i just and in her nursing office she had an extra room so i said okay i'm gonna set up shop there you guys come in i wasn't charging anybody at the beginning because i wasn't sure i knew what i was doing and we'll just experiment and the thing it just blew up just like blew up and within about nine months we had it we rented another space in that same building 3 000 square feet we set it up within a year and a half we moved into\n10:02\nanother building that was 10 000 square feet so the thing just mushroomed and as as i got better at it i left the emergency room and i she and i went all over the country learning from various doctors who had kind of non-traditional approaches to helping people who had injuries or illnesses that regular doctors weren't being very successful and so that's kind of what we've ended up with now that's awesome i love it and it in and that kind of morphed into your your supplement business as well now um yeah because yeah because originally\n10:43\nin 2000 there weren't very many products to detoxify mercury safely when we first started we were doing an iv solution it's a medicine called dmsa or dmps but this stuff is toxic and patients would get an iv of this stuff and at the end of the treatment they'd be holding their back because their kidneys were affected by the toxicity of the medicine so i found a nutritional biochemist and and we worked together to develop a product that would safely remove heavy metals from the body it's called metal\n11:16\nfree and we've been selling it for 20 years and i used it first in the practice and then other doctors heard about it and we saw we started this company called body health and now we sell it to doctors all over the world it's really a good product it's very safe and it can detoxify the heavy metals from someone uh without them getting sick that's awesome so i read your book and i really appreciate appreciated what you had to say about amino acids okay and if my listeners don't know the the name of your book is the search for\n11:51\nthe perfect protein it's available on amazon and all sorts of other places and i really loved how you broke down amino acid profiles in this book because protein is protein is protein is not really the case and a lot of people think like we have lots of people of different nutritional beliefs such as being vegan or keto or who knows what they all think that a gram of protein is just a gram of protein and your book kind of breaks that down so today i'm hoping that we can expand on that a little bit absolutely um this is not taught in\n12:33\nin dietary science it is not taught in nutritional science and i never learned it before i sort of ran into it by accident",

    "prompt": "IoT Security Workshop: Video Interception\n1\nIoT Security - Video Interception\nBackground\nThis IoT experiment demonstrates the vulnerability in video image streaming when associated with a\nlocal Access Point. Unlike the other IoT lab experiments we do not need to gain access to the Access\nPoint ID/password but rather we scan the frequency spectrum to find a channel in which video images\nare being transmitted. We are not intercepting or altering these images \u2013 merely copying them out\nusing a set of IoT analysis tools.\nIn this experiment the video images are not encrypted \u2013 which is very commonly the case in practice! If\nthese images were encrypted then this adds another layer of analysis which has parallels to some of the\nother experiments. The fact that TCP/IP data can be pulled out of a discovered frequency channel \u2013 as\nused by all Access Points is quite alarming.\nThis experiment is carried out with some simple and inexpensive tools \u2013 Virtual Machines, an Alfa or\nWiPi USB adaptor, server for the video images, Access Point, switch or hub and an IP camera \u2013 all for a\nfew hundred dollars. Thus the quality of what we will extract \u2013 particularly with respect to the pixels is\nlimited, but it does illustrate what could be done to an IoT video network with more expensive tools.\nConfiguration\nThe following diagram shows the configuration that you need to set up.\nIoT interception on wireless interconnection of IP camera with server via the Access Point\nThe Forensic Camera should be configured for you with an IP address of 192.168.0.90/24 and login\nroot/toor. To carry out any camera reconfiguration set the VM IP address to 192.168.0.70/24, connect\ninitially by Ethernet cable to the camera and make sure that you can ping the camera. The video server\nbehind the Access Point should be set to 192.168.0.80/24. You should be able to ping between\n192.168.0.70 (Capture Machine), 192.168.0.60 (Access Point), 192.168.0.80 (Video Server) and\n192.168.0.90 (Video Camera). Note that the IP connection from your VM (192.168.0.70) is only required\nfor testing and configuration. For the wireless capture in the frequency spectrum, no IP address nor\nconnection is necessary.\nIoT Security Workshop: Video Interception\n2\nAxis 270 IP camera interception test network diagram.\nSummary of set up\nVM for camera configuration and to run IoT interception tools:\nKali Linux Backtrack IoT Version (root/toor)\nifconfig \u2013a to obtain Ethernet interfaces\nifconfig ethx 192.168.0.70/24\nVM for Video Server \u2013 Transfer of VM for FTP Server Forensics\n(root/toor/startx)\nifconfig \u2013a to obtain Ethernet interfaces\nifconfig ethx 192.168.0.80/24\nCISCO Linksys Access Point\n192.168.0.60 MAC 00:22:6B:E9:1A:E7\nNotes\n1.

Bring up the camera folders at file system > srv > ftp > uploads > 90 etc\n3. Make sure pixel setting is 320x240 and 90% compression\n4. Ensure firewall is off on base machines\n5. In IP camera configuration, make sure that the Wireless IP addresses is set (TCP/IP) and enabled and\nIP-Forensics Access Point is selected (Wireless)\nCheck that you have the following initial configuration for your IP camera:\nIoT Security Workshop: Video Interception\n3\nIoT Security Workshop: Video Interception\n4\nUse uploads/90 (above) if your camera is configured to 192.168.0.90\nIoT Security Workshop: Video Interception\n5\nSet your IP address for the IP camera (wired and Wireless) to be 192.168.0.90 if not already set.\nStart with a pixel setting of 320x240 and a compression of 90% in order to keep the uploaded video\nimages files relatively small and less likely to be subject to interference but this will depend upon the\nbackground level of wireless traffic \u2013 on the selected channel in particular.\nIoT Security Workshop: Video Interception\n6\nSubsequently you can experiment with higher pixel settings but this will increased the probability of\nerror frames which depends upon the background interference. Although running under TCP/IP\nwould normally mean error correction is in place \u2013 you are not connected to this pipe!\nConfiguration of your IoT VM interception and analysis VM\nOnce the VM is running your IP address is only relevant if you want to experiment with changing\nsettings in the IP camera.\nMakes sure that your Alfa or WiPi USB adaptor is connected through to your VM as follows:\nTo kill the DHCP client, type:\nps \u2013eaf | grep dhc\n(e: show every process on the system; a: except session processes; f: formatted output. See man ps)\nThis command will search for all the running processes and filter those which start with dhc. By looking\nat the processID (1956 in this case, it may change in your case), then enter:\nkill -9 (9 means all levels and essentially kills the dhc process)\nIoT Security Workshop: Video Interception\n7\nDo not get confused with the ProcessIDs for root (2002 and 1650 in this example) as this is the process\nthat you are running to kill the dhcp client. You should end up with a single line which is the kill process\nyou are running as below:\nTo perform a general scan for wireless Access Points, enter the following command:\nairodump-ng wlanx (could be wlan0, wlan1 \u2026..)\nNow set you IoT device into Monitor Mode\nIn order for us to capture the wireless packets, the wireless card must be put into \"Monitor Mode\", in\norder to facilitate the capture of packets in a Passive manner.

After capture analyse\nthe Wireshark trace. Select a ftp-data frame (see below) and go to Analyse > Follow TCP Stream and\nwe should see files which start with JPEG for snapshots.\nSet up an ftp-data filter as below\nThe image below shows a capture filter for traffic with source address of one of the IP cameras\n(192.168.0.90) and destination address of the FTP server (192.168.0.80). Filter Pull-Down Menu.\nIoT Security Workshop: Video Interception\n9\nOn your Wireshark machine, save this captured file as \u2013 for example \u2013 IoT-image.jpg on the desk top.\nA copy will also have been received by the server in your uploads directory but you do not see this\nwhen carrying out an interception analysis.\nWireshark will show some details of the Radio Frequency interface and Channel 10 in particular in\nour case as below.\nIoT Security Workshop: Video Interception\n10\nSummary of key issues in this IoT video interception workshop\n(i) There is no wired connection and no wireless connection for layer 3 and above (IP/TCP/UDP)\nand thus no TCP segment repeat in the face of error.\n(ii) It is necessary to force the lowest speed possible \u2013 therefore it is best to configure 802.11b in\npreference to 802.11g/a/n in the Access Point\n(iii) It is necessary to carry out some sort of frequency spectrum analysis to find out in which\nfrequency band we need to look for these TCP segments. For example possible frequency\nbands are: 2.417GHz (Ch 2), 2.437GHz (Ch 6), 2.457GHz (Ch 10). airodump-ng on the\nappropriate wireless channel can be used to assist with this as well.\n(iv) It is necessary to experiment with different wireless channels \u2013 in particular 2, 6 and 10 in\norder to find a ping injection test with 100% success rate. This will involve removing\ninterfering devices as far as possible. Other Access Points in the vicinity can cause problems.\n(v) The appropriate drivers need to be loaded for the wireless card to be used, e.g. Alfa\nAWUS036H 802.11b/g Long-Range Wireless USB Adapter or the WiPi adaptor.\n(vi) Because there is no opportunity to correct errors then ideally we wish to capture an image\nwithout error and therefore 3-4 segments gives us the best opportunity. This means that we\nneed to keep the pixel setting low, e.g. 320 x 240 and keep the compression high, e.g. 90%.\nIoT Security Workshop: Video Interception\n11\nThis should result in a file size of (say) 3.5KB. Remember that the maximum frame size is 1448\nbytes being the maximum Ethernet frame size minus headers. In this case there will be a\nspecial header (Prism capture header) inserted in front of the IEEE802.11 data.\nWireless capture using Wireshark but with no TCP connection nor IP address:\n90% compression; image 320 x 240 pixels\n(vii) If you do multiple triggers so as to transfer a number of .jpg images within one Wireshark\ncapture then you must determine which FTP-DATA segments belong to which image.\nFortunately this can be done by inspecting the TCP \u201cStream index\u201d, e.g. [Stream index: 2].\n(viii) It is not worth trying to Analyse > Follow TCP Stream, save and view images where there are\ntransmission errors introduced by noise and interference. Thus spend some time ensuring that\nyou have a complete stream (stream index) with no error segments for your IoT experiment.\n(ix) Develop this experiment with slightly higher pixel values \u2013 but only up to the point where you\ncan ensure that there are no error segments.\n(x) Sometimes black lines appear across an image indicating corruption which Wireshark cannot\nresolve. Sometimes frames get out of order but without noise interference.\nThis picture below shows that going back to 640 x 480 pixels can provide better picture quality but\nthe packets can easily get out of order and chopped in the Wireshark decoding process. This is highly\ndependent upon background interference factors which can affect this IoT operation.",

    "prompt": "Context on DMalloc:\nAssignment Roadmap\nThis section describes the main functionality required for the debugging allocator, ordered from simpler to more complex and from low-numbered to high-numbered tests.\n\nStatistics\nIn the stencil code there is a function print\\_statistics() that uses the information stored in a statistics struct to print out statistics about all the memory allocations so far.\n\nThe statistics struct is defined as follows (see dmalloc.hh):\n\nstruct dmalloc\\_stats {\n unsigned long long nactive; // number of active allocations [#malloc - #free]\n unsigned long long active\\_size; // number of bytes in active allocations\n unsigned long long ntotal; // number of allocations, total\n unsigned long long total\\_size; // number of bytes in allocations, total\n unsigned long long nfail; // number of failed allocation attempts\n unsigned long long fail\\_size; // number of bytes in failed allocation attempts\n uintptr\\_t heap\\_min; // smallest address in any region ever allocated\n uintptr\\_t heap\\_max; // largest address in any region ever allocated\n}; \nIt is up to you to fill in the function get\\_statistics(statistics \\*stats) so that accurate information is stored in an instance of dmalloc\\_stats. To do this, think about using a global variable that holds a struct and which any calls to dmalloc() and dfree(ptr) update.\n\nTask: Implement the get\\_statistics function in dmalloc.cc.\n\nHints!\nMost of these statistics are easy to track, and you should tackle them first (start by passing tests 1-5 and 7-10).\n\nThe trickier test is active\\_size. To track this information, your dfree(ptr) implementation must find the number of bytes allocated for the block pointed to by ptr. This is because after a block is freed, active\\_size should decrease by the size of that block.\n\nThe easiest, and probably best, way to do this is for your dmalloc code to request more space than the user required when it calls base\\_malloc. This extra space will allow you to store metadata about the allocated block alongside it. This metadata can store a structure you define yourself, and it should keep track of the allocated block size. As you write your debugging allocator, you may realize you want to store other information as well. The metadata will be stored at the beginning of an allocated block, but dmalloc should still return a pointer to the \u201cpayload\u201d of the block, i.e., to the space after the metadata. You will need to use pointer arithmetic to return a pointer that points somewhere just beyond the metadata. In dfree(ptr), the ptr argument then must be a pointer to the payload of a block (because that\u2019s what dmalloc returned before), but you can use pointer arithmetic again to access the metadata stored just before ptr to access the block\u2019s size. Consider what bugs might emerge when adding metadata near your allocated block and how you might resolve them!\n\nQuick reminders on pointer arithmetic:\n\nYou can use the function sizeof() to get the size of a datatype.\nbase\\_malloc returns a void\\*, which is a pointer without a type. Before you can do pointer arithmetic, you will need to cast the void\\* pointer to have a type. However, dmalloc should still return a void\\*.\nWhen you incremement a pointer, the pointer\u2019s address will jump ahead by the size of the pointer\u2019s datatype.\nRun make check to run the test programs. Specifically, test001 through test011 should pass when you are done with this section.\n\nInteger overflow protection\nYour debugging malloc library also needs to be robust against integer overflow attacks. Integer overflow occurs when you try to allocate a number of bytes that is too large. For example, the size\\_t type of the first argument to dmalloc is a type alias for an unsigned long data type, which is comprised of 8 bytes. When you compute the number of bytes to request and it exceeds the maximum possible integer, the value of the size\\_t wraps around to 0. Consider, for example, the calloc function in the stencil code, think about how overflow could occur, and then fix it.\n\nTask: Implement the overflow protection in dmalloc() and dcalloc().\n\ntest012 through test015 should pass after this is done correctly. Make sure that test015 succeeds on the grading server too; if you get a test timeout on the grading server, your overflow checks are not quite right.\n\nInvalid free and double-free detection\ndfree(ptr) should print an error message and then call C\u2019s abort() function when ptr does not point to active dynamically-allocated memory. There are several cases when this might occur.\n\nThe test programs define the desired error message format. Here\u2019s our error message for test016:\n\nMEMORY BUG: test016.cc:8: invalid free of pointer 0xffffffffffffffe0, not in heap\nError messages should be printed to standard error (using C\u2019s fprintf(stderr, ...)). Different error situations require different error messages; the other test programs define the required messages.\n\nTask: Check for invalid and double frees in dfree() and print an appropriate error message.\n\nHints!\nptr needs to point somewhere on the heap. How are you tracking the allocated space on the heap?\n\nYou need to catch double frees (when free is called on the same pointer twice)! How can you determine whether or not a block is freed?\n\nptr must be a pointer to the beginning of an allocated memory block, not just any address on the heap. Knowing your metadata header should be stored in memory right before ptr, how can you guarantee you are actually accessing a header?\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to store more information in your metadata!\n\ntest016 through test024 should pass after this is done correctly.\n\nBoundary write error detection\nA boundary error is when a program reads or writes memory beyond the actual dimensions of an allocated memory block.\n\nA debugging memory allocator can\u2019t detect boundary read errors, but it can detect many boundary write errors. Your dfree(ptr) should print an error message and call abort() if it detects that the memory block associated with ptr suffered a boundary write error.\n\nTask: Check for boundary write errors in dfree() and print an appropriate error message.\n\nHints!\nAs a strategy for detecting boundary write errors, consider adding data with a known (\u201csecret\u201d) value around the boundaries of your allocation, and then check that value in appropriate places.\n\nNo debugging allocator can reliably detect all boundary write errors. For example, consider this:\n\nint\\* array = (int\\*) malloc(10 \\* sizeof(int));\nint secret = array[10]; // save boundary value\narray[10] = 1384139431; // boundary write error\narray[10] = secret; // restore old value! dmalloc can\u2019t tell there was an error!\nOr this:\n\nint\\* array = (int\\*) malloc(10 \\* sizeof(int));\narray[200000] = 0; // a boundary write error, but very far from the boundary!\nWe\u2019re just expecting your code to catch common simple cases where the user writes one or more bytes directly after the allocated block.\n\ntest025 through test027 should pass after this is done correctly. Note that test 27 and following invoke undefined behavior (and make assumptions about the compiler\u2019s choices for it) in order to test your implementation. You don\u2019t need to pass these and the higher-numbered tests with sanitizers enabled.\n\nMemory leak reporting\nA memory leak happens when code allocates a block of memory, but then forgets to free it. Memory leaks are not as serious as other memory errors, particularly in short-running programs. They don\u2019t cause a crash, and the operating system always reclaims all of a program\u2019s memory when the program exits. But in long-running programs, such as your browser or the operating system itself, memory leaks have serious effect and are important to avoid.\n\nFill in the print\\_leak\\_report() function such that, when called, it prints a report about every allocated object in the system. This report should list every object that has been allocated via dmalloc but not freed using dfree. Print the report to standard output (not standard error). A report should look like this:\n\nLEAK CHECK: test033.cc:23: allocated object 0x9b811e0 with size 19\nLEAK CHECK: test033.cc:21: allocated object 0x9b81170 with size 17\nLEAK CHECK: test033.cc:20: allocated object 0x9b81140 with size 16\nLEAK CHECK: test033.cc:19: allocated object 0x9b81110 with size 15\nLEAK CHECK: test033.cc:18: allocated object 0x9b810e0 with size 14\nLEAK CHECK: test033.cc:16: allocated object 0x9b81080 with size 12\nLEAK CHECK: test033.cc:15: allocated object 0x9b81050 with size 11\nA programmer will use this leak checker by calling print\\_leak\\_report() before exiting the program, after freeing all allocated dynamic memory they recall. Any missing frees will show up in the leak report!\n\nTask: Implement print\\_leak\\_report().\n\nHints!\nThere are multiple ways to do this. Here are some things that might be helpful:\n\nstd::pair \u2013 a C++ object that contains two data elements (similar to a tuple with two members).\n\nstd::map \u2013 C++ key-value map. You will need to add #include at the top of dmalloc.cc to use this.\n\nmap::begin \u2013 returns an iterator referring to the first element in the map container.\n\nstd::unordered\\_map \u2013 C++ key-value hash map. You will need to add #include at the top of dmalloc.cc to use it. If you get strange and scary compiler errors when using this data structure, it\u2019s likely because the compiler doesn\u2019t know how to hash your key type. Check out this guide for more information.\n\ntest028 through test030 should pass after this is done correctly.\n\nAdvanced reports and checking\nThis is the home stretch!\n\nTo make your debugger even more robust, you should print better information and defend against more complex invalid frees. You will need to read the test code and understand what is being tested to defend against it.\n\nUpdate your invalid free message. After determining that a pointer is invalid, your code should check whether the pointer is inside a different allocated block. This will use the same structures you created for the leak checker. If the invalid pointer is inside another block, print out that block, like so:\n\nMEMORY BUG: test031.cc:10: invalid free of pointer 0x833306c, not allocated\n test031.cc:9: 0x833306c is 100 bytes inside a 2001 byte region allocated here\nAlso make sure your invalid free detector can handle more diabolical situations. What situations? Check the test code to find out!\n\nTask: If an invalid free occurs within an already allocated block print an appropriate error message.\n\ntest031 through test033 should pass after this is done correctly.\n\nPerformance and C++ integration\nFinally, test programs 34 to 39 test other situations that allow you to check that your debugging allocator is efficent and compatible with C++ style memory alocation (not just C style memory allocation).\n\ntest034 calls dmalloc 500,000 times, supplying tens of thousands of different filename/line-number pairs. Ideally, your solution should run test034 in a second or less.\n\nTask: Meet the performance requirement!\n\nAll tests should pass after this is done correctly! :tada:\n\nNote: C++ introduces a new paradigm for dynamic memory allocation with the new and delete keywords. These keywords are designed to work with C++ classes, but under the hood they work simply by using malloc and free respectively.\n\n---\n\n7. Project 2: DMalloc (4 points)\nQUESTION 7A. Like your DMalloc implementation, the standard C malloc implementation also stores metadata with each allocation. Below, we show you a slightly simplified version of that metadata, which stores the size of each allocation and whether that allocation has been freed in a header:\n\n[Malloc Memory Diagram, showing that before the payload in each malloc allocation, there is data on the size of the allocation and a flag representing whether this allocation has been freed.]\n\nDescribe two memory errors that can occur using malloc\u2019s metadata implementation, but not using DMalloc's. Explain how your DMalloc implementation fixes these problems.",
    "answer": "1. Double-free error:\nIn the standard C malloc implementation, when a block of memory is freed, the metadata is updated to indicate that the block is now free. However, it does not prevent a subsequent call to free the same memory block, which can lead to a double-free error. This can cause various issues, such as memory corruption, as another allocation might reuse the same memory block that was marked as free.\n\nDMalloc fixes this issue by keeping track of allocated and freed memory blocks in its own data structures. When a call to dfree(ptr) is made, DMalloc checks if the pointer points to an active allocation. If the block has already been freed, DMalloc will report an error message and abort the program, preventing a double-free situation.\n\n1. Boundary write errors:\nIn the standard C malloc implementation, there is no built-in mechanism to detect if a program writes beyond the boundaries of the allocated memory block. Writing past the boundaries can overwrite the metadata of adjacent memory blocks or corrupt other data, which can lead to unpredictable behavior or crashes.\n\nDMalloc addresses this issue by adding \"guard\" data with known values (also known as \"canaries\") around the boundaries of the allocated memory block. When dfree(ptr) is called, DMalloc checks the guard data to ensure that it has not been altered. If the guard data has been modified, DMalloc reports a boundary write error and abort",

Rather, the owners sought leave to appeal on each of the grounds that the decision was against the weight of evidence, that the decision was not fair and equitable, and that there was significant new evidence now available that was not reasonably available at the time of the hearing.\n\nIt is convenient to address in turn each of the items in respect of which the appellants seek leave to appeal.\n\nContract price adjustment\n\nUnder clause 44.4 of the building contract, the builder was entitled to a contract price adjustment of 2.5% if the commencement period (350 days after the date of the tender) expired without all conditions governing commencement being satisfied.\n\nDemolition was not completed until 21 February 2019, that is well after the expiry of the 350 days within which the building work was required to commence if the builder was not to be entitled to the contract price adjustment.\n\nWe note that the Tribunal identified the date on which demolition was completed as 21 January 2019. This appears to have been an inadvertent error, but it is not significant as that date was still 3 days after the date on which the contract price adjustment became operative.\n\nBefore demolition could commence, a construction certificate was required. The owners asserted that the builder had deliberately delayed the obtaining of the construction certificate. The circumstances in which that allegation is made are set out in the decision at [18]-[23] as follows:\n\n18. DC [Development Consent] condition 47 required a Sydney Water s 73 compliance certificate under the Sydney Water Act 1994 (NSW).\n\n19. On 2 November 2018 a Sydney Water Servicing Co-ordinator (RAR) issued a s 73 works proposal for works to obtain the required approval for a dual occupancy. On 9 November RAR emailed asking that the builder arrange for peg out report and structural engineering plans. Peg out was finished on 12 November. On 12 November the builder said that it requested from its engineer (Donovans) Building Over/Adjacent to Sewer (BOS) detail and enclosed a purchase order.\n\n20. On 23 November 2018 Donovans, in response to an email from the builder, told the builder that the request was not received and if resent would be completed that day. The email was immediately resent with the 12 November email appearing in the chain. The structural engineering detail including BOS detail was emailed 7 December 2018 to the builder, 14 days later, who forwarded it to RAR on 10 December 2018 with the comment \u201cThis one has taken forever!\u201d\n\n21. On 12 December 2018 RAR sought from the builder confirmation that the rear fence/retaining wall was part of the approval. The builder confirmed that was part of the works 18 minutes later and also said that the builder co-ordinator had advised that the stormwater (OSD) may impact on Sydney Water assets.\n\n22. On 14 December 2018 RAR requested Donovans to include the retaining wall on the engineering plans. Donovans used that revised detail on 17 December which also included BOS.\n\n23.

The builder \u201cduly advised\u201d the owners who were doing their own demolition. \u2026 The completion of demolition was when the builder obtained vacant possession of the site to commence works under cl 48.5.\n\nThe owners asserted that the builder did not send an email to the engineer on 12 November 2018. The owners asserted that the email bearing that date, produced by the builder in response to a summons, was not genuine.\n\nThe email bearing the date 12 November 2018 also appeared in an email chain, which included an email from Mr Francis of the builder to the engineer dated 23 November following up the earlier email, and a response from the engineer stating that that email had not been received.\n\nThe owners\u2019 position, as articulated at the oral hearing of the appeal, was that the email had been sent by Mr Francis on 12 November 2018, but not to the engineer. The owners submitted that Mr Francis had deliberately misdirected the email to ensure it was not received by the engineer, in order to delay the obtaining of a construction certificate, so as to ensure the builder obtained the benefit of the price increase, and had then inserted the correct address into the email, so as to make it appear it had been sent to the engineer on 12 November 2018.\n\nThe Tribunal dealt with that submission in the decision under appeal at paragraphs [32] to [35] as follows:\n\n32. There was no independent expert evidence to substantiate the allegation that the builder effectively forged the email chain on 23 November 2018. There was a document on how to create a forged email which in itself established a methodology, not that it had been used. Such would have required analysis of the builder\u2019s computers and Donovan\u2019s computers, the latter to see if there was non-receipt (and if so for what reason) or whether it had been received and overlooked or inadvertently deleted. It would also have required analysis of the alleged anomaly in the way the recipient was styled. There was no evidence on such analysis.\n\n33. Without independent expert analysis and in the face of the builder\u2019s denials I cannot accept that such a serious allegation is established.\n\n34. Further, there is an email from an employee of the builder to the owners on 23 November 2018 that the Sydney Water approval relied upon the engineering plans \u201cthat are due back any day now\u201d. This is consistent with either an elaborate fraud for no clear reason at that point in time (some 56 days before the commencement period ran out) or that the plans had been requested when the builder said.\n\n35. I consider the latter inference is the correct one on the evidence. At this point there was no reason to engage in a cover-up of delays which may or may not \u2013 with about eight weeks of time to go \u2013 impact the issue of the CC and hence demolition. If the email to the owners was sent before Donovans advised that the 12 November email had not been received, then the sending employee of the builder would not know of the alleged non-receipt (or misplacement). If the email to the owners was sent after Donovans advised, then the employee could reasonably expect a rapid turnaround given Donovan\u2019s response.\n\nWe agree with the Tribunal\u2019s characterisation of the owners\u2019 submission and with its conclusion.\n\nThe evidence relied upon by the owners to establish that the email was not genuine was a statement prepared by Mr Hua Yong Tan which described how it was possible to do what Mr Tan asserted Mr Francis had done. However, there was no evidence to demonstrate that Mr Francis had actually done what Mr Tan asserted he had done.\n\nWhen this proposition was put to Mr Tan in the course of the appeal hearing, he stated that certain features of the email disclosed that it was not genuine, in particular a change in the way the email address of the engineer was disclosed between the various versions of the email.\n\nMr Tan submitted that emails did not work that way, but he acknowledged that he could only say that was the case with the email system he used, and he could not say that the builder used the same email system.\n\nA finding that a person has engaged in fraud is a serious allegation, which is not to be made on the basis of \u201cinexact proofs, indefinite testimony, or indirect references\u201d: Briginshaw v Briginshaw (1938) 60 CLR 336 at 362.\nAlthough Mr Francis did not give evidence to confirm that he had sent the email on 12 November or to deny that he had forged the copy produced on summons and included in the email chain, and there was no explanation for his failure to do so, in our view that is not sufficient to lead to an inference that he did forge the email, in circumstances where there is nothing to suggest that he did so which rises beyond speculation.\n\nWhere a witness, who might be expected to be able to give evidence about a matter and might be expected to be called by one party rather than the other, is not called to give evidence, and no explanation is provided for their absence, that may lead to an inference that the uncalled evidence would not have assisted the party\u2019s case: Jones v Dunkel (1959) 61 CLR 298. However, \u201cthe rule in Jones v Dunkel cannot be employed to fill in gaps in the evidence or to convert conjecture and suspicion into inference\u201d: Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 1062 per Sackville J at [472].\n\nThe owners also suggested that the builder had not \u201caccepted the engineer\u2019s offer\u201d, to provide the required \u201cBOS detail\u201d by the close of business on 23 November if the request was re-sent that day.\n\nIt appears the Tribunal concluded that the email was immediately re-sent.\n\nAlthough Mr Vardas, who represented the builder on the appeal, stated that he could show it had been sent, he could not point to evidence before the Tribunal to establish that proposition. To that extent, it does appear that the Tribunal made the finding that the email was immediately re-sent without evidence. A finding made without evidence is an error of law (see Prendergast, cited at [13] above).\n\nIf the email was not immediately re-sent, it might be said that the builder was responsible for two weeks delay in obtaining the BOS, between 23 November and 7 December. However, as the Tribunal found, it was not sufficient for the owners to demonstrate that the builder had been responsible for some delay. To avoid liability for the price increase, the owners needed to establish that the builder\u2019s delay had been the cause of the fact that the work had not started by the relevant date.\n\nThere was no evidence before the Tribunal to establish that a two week delay in the provision of the BOS was responsible for the owners not completing demolition until 21 February (or even 21 January) 2019. Even if the builder was responsible for a two week delay in obtaining the construction certificate, the owners did not establish that that delay caused the owners to incur liability for the cost adjustment. Accordingly, any error of law involved in the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the email of 12 November 2018 was immediately re-sent was immaterial to the outcome of the proceedings.\n\nThe owners sought to rely upon evidence which had not been before the Tribunal at first instance to establish:\n\nThat the email of 12 November 2018 was forged; and\n\nThat the delay in the provision of the BOS had caused the appellants to incur liability for the contract price adjustment.\n\nMr Tan did not provide any reason why that evidence was not available at the initial hearing, beyond the proposition that he did not think it was necessary because he was confident that the Tribunal would accept his argument on the evidence he did provide.\n\nThe question when evidence is reasonably available was addressed in Al-Daouk v Mr Pine Pty Ltd t/as Furnco Bankstown [2015] NSWCATAP 111 at [19]-[26]. At [23] the Appeal Panel held:\n\n\u2026 the test of whether evidence is reasonably available is not to be considered by reference to any subjective explanation from the party seeking leave but, rather, by applying an objective test and considering whether the evidence in question was unavailable because no person could have reasonably obtained the evidence.\n\nIt is clear from that decision that the fact that Mr Tan did not realise the evidence was necessary does not satisfy the requirement that the evidence not have been reasonably available at the time of the initial hearing.\n\nThe Appeal Panel is not satisfied that the fresh evidence sought to be relied upon by Mr Tan was not reasonably available at the time of the initial hearing and accordingly we refuse the owners leave to rely upon it.\n\nWe note that the builder submitted that the proposed further evidence did not overcome the deficiencies in the owners\u2019 case, but we do not need to determine that question.\n\nWe find no error in the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the owners were liable for the cost price adjustment and refuse leave to appeal in respect of that finding.",

    "prompt": "can you assess the strong points and areas for improvement ifor the research proposal of an undergraduate student below, focusing on paragraph cohesion, sentence balance, flow and spelling and grammar accuracy. if possible add an assessment if the language level in English, based on the Common European Framework - \n\nIntegrating the hospice care involving Buddhist insights among Chinese mainland cancer patients and their families.\n\n \nCao tinglu \n\n\nAbstract\nBuddhism,as one of the three main religions in contemporary world,like the other two, possessing its own special theories and belief when it comes to death.This paper firstly introduces the definitions of both hospice care and general Buddhist teachings towards end of life care ,and then traces back the history of Buddhism hospice care among incurable cancer patients and their family as well as discusses the development situation of it.Following by that,a deeper theme in the light of examining the benefits for Buddhist teachings application to hospice care towards terminally ill cancer patients and their families in mainland China is clearly demonstrated. Based on a selected body of literature reviews and historical primary texts,plus a number of field works and comparative analysis,this paper shows that Buddhist teachings are helpful during periods of suffering and can facilitate the patients and their family members peacefully accept the death. It also puts forward how people face death reality and the way they use to comfort themselves pacifically in the last period of their life could indicate different qualities of death.The purpose and the value of this thesis aims at attempting to integrate Buddhist philosophy combining with medical hospice care among incurable cancer patients and family members in China mainland to diminish their excruciation in dealing with facing death . \n\nKey words: Buddhism,Buddhist teachings (philosophy),Hospice care, Peaceful Death. \n\nIntroduction\n\nAccording to the the study,hospice care is defined as predominantly community based program that provides interprofessional multidimensional care for patients with terminal illness(i.e,expected survival<6months) and their families,working in conjunction with volunteers to provide services ranging from symptom management to bereavement care.(Hui et al. 2013).And Buddhist teachings have the lasting correlation to relate death to life,plus, some of the practices like mindfulness, meditation are widely popularized among people in the world to help release the pressure and pain in daily life and has become an important element of psychotherapeutic treatment,the application to hospice care involving Buddhist philosophy among cancer patient and their family might also been taken into consideration.Moreover,a study shows that Japan-Korea-Taiwan research network has been set up as a collaboration which requires for the East-Asian collaborative cross-cultural study to elucidate the dying process (EASED) cohort. (Cheng et al, 2016). According to this research, the Hospice and Palliative Care Unit of the National Taiwan University Hospital was looking into applying Buddha dharma in terminal care. And, In 2004, the Japan Association for Buddhist Nursing and Vihara Studies was initiated by the former president of the Buddhist University Yukimasa Mizutani and Professor Hitoshi Tamiya, who advocated for Buddhist hospice care.They did so in order to organize the Buddhist community to conduct research on Buddhist nursing and end-of-life care.(\u5f20\u6587\u826fZhang Wenliang,2018). In addition to Taiwan and Japan,in South Korea , Buddhist hospice care was introduced by Venerable Haedo, who studied social welfare and the vihara movement in Japan. (Tedesco, 1998). According to Tedesco,earlier in 1994, the Buddhist Volunteer Service Association trained volunteers in South Korea to help the chronically ill and dying (Tedesco 1998).\nThough Buddhism consequently evolved into various ways,Buddhist healing has since its transmission remained a considerable correlation with the health care domain in the region.(Salguero et al,2020) However,it is notable that Buddhism was introduced to China in the late Han Dynasty(206BCE-220CE), and many Buddhist texts concentrate on the illness as a location to consummate Buddhist meditation practices(Capitanio,J.2013),unlike Japan-Korea-Taiwan,there still lacks end of life care integration with Buddhist teachings in China mainland among the populace.Therefore,there remains a research gap about how to integrate a Buddhist hospice palliative care in mainland China among the terminally ill patients and their families. But, Is it beneficial to apply Buddhist mindfulness to hospice palliative care among cancer patients and their families in mainland China?Although many people have a general idea of what Buddhist teachings entail,they do not apply it correctly nor integrate it fully into their daily life. In the light of this,a solution to fill this research gap will be explored as there are numbers of people who rely on Buddhist philosophy to free themselves from sufferings both spiritually and physically in China mainland. This paper means to answer this question. \nMethods & Expected Results \nPrimary text analysis and literature reviews as well as case studies are used to answer main research question Is it beneficial to apply Buddhist teachings to hospice care among cancer patients and their families in mainland China? The historical evidences and their influences on the society at that time are collected by using primary text analysis.And then,via studying different successful development cases mainly in Japan and Taiwan as well as analyzing number of literature correlations,the reasons and gap why there is little cases happened in contemporary mainland China will be gradually presented.Thirdly, some online field work will be conducted to settle the sub-research questions like how the people view the Buddhist philosophy in their daily life in mainland China as well as examine if the people (patients and their family )actively adopt Buddhist teachings and practices regard with life and death to help them reduce the mental suffering in the terminally ill condition.At last, all the data will be collected and sorted out via content analyzing and coding to highlight the factors that limit the development of involving Buddhist philosophy among cancer patient and their family as well as noting the benefits for their status and changes. \nAs above mentioned,the research will start with analyzing the historical text by using narratives analysis and discourse analysis mainly in some Buddhist scriptures which can directly present the traces of history,like \u6742\u963f\u542b \u5377\u4e94\u7b2c103\u7ecf\uff0c\u537737\u7b2c1023\u7ecf\uff0c\u7b2c1024\u7ecf\uff0c\u7b2c1025\u7ecf\uff0c\u537741\uff0c\u7b2c1122\u7ecf\u3002\u589e\u4e00\u963f\u542b\u7ecf\uff0c\u537748. \u56db\u5206\u5f8b\u884c\u4e8b\u6284 \uff0c\u5927\u5510\u897f\u57df\u8bb0\uff0c\u534e\u4e25\u7ecfetc.And then,by comparing the literature reviews Advances of hospice palliative care in Taiwan (Cheng et al. 2016), Factors related to spiritual well-being in the last days of life in three East Asian countries: An international multicenter prospective cohort study, Palliative Medicine(Hiratsuka et.al,2021), A cross-cultural comparison of hospice development in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan(Glass,et.al) etc to identify the development of the Buddhist Dharma among cancer patient and their family in Japan and Taiwan.This step is suitable for analyzing the similarities and possible gaps. The online field is conducted through taking field notes from the patients blog&mini log and their family members\u2019 dairy blog in the online forum to help find the effective elements to the development of hospice palliative care involving Buddhist thoughts among cancer patient and their family in mainland China.As in this way can help to perceive more authentic emotion with the target group.Because this kind of resources are relatively limited,therefore,all the posts that can be found will be recorded. In terms of the data selection,some true factors that rightly exert the influence on the application to the Buddhism among cancer patient and their family in mainland China in hospice care are expected.They could be from every aspects of the society,namely patients and their family members,medical staff and hospital management including the Buddhist religion group.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion\n\n Because of the shortage of the contemporary English academia resources among this topic in mainland China, the preliminary resources from Buddhist sutra and the secondary English resources tend to more precious,which brings the novelty into this research.Further more,what are the differences between the hospice care with and without Buddhism intervention while facing the death ? According to Harding,theological religiosity was the only one to have a significant effect on death acceptance and death anxiety (Harding,el.al,2005),it delivers the information that this research paper is on the right way that deserves to explore further.As the purpose and the value of this paper aims at attempting to integrate Buddhism teachings with medical hospice care among cancer patients and family members in China mainland, mastering interdisciplinary knowledge regarding many of the aspects become essentially important ,for instance,to disclose the historical evidence of Buddhism hospice care towards terminally ill patients and their families could give an enlightenment and a guidance to contemporary hospice care system in a more spiritual-care orientation,and to find the research answers by comparing the successful development cases in Japan and Taiwan in converse could affect the humanitarian progress in Chinese hospice care system.Though,the study has the limitation of taking face to face interview and getting more vivid reactions and attitudes from the target patients and their families,plus,during the covid time,it is uneasy to have access to go back to mainland China,the online field work makes sense as more exclusive expression of the authentic emotional thoughts which might not be displayed in front of the public from target patients can be collected.Most importantly,the study could in favor of diminishing people\u2019s excruciation in dealing with facing death ,after all ,this is the destination which everyone will set foot on .\nReferences :\n\nCapitanio, J.

    "answer": "Overall, the research proposal demonstrates a good command of the English language, with a few grammatical errors and sentence structures that could be improved. There is an effective use of paragraph cohesion and flow, as the writer moves from discussing the definition of hospice care and Buddhist teachings to examining the history of Buddhist hospice care among cancer patients and their families. However, the paper could benefit from a more concise and direct introduction and conclusion to clearly state the research question and findings.\n\nIn terms of language level based on the Common European Framework, the paper appears to be at a B2 level, demonstrating an ability to communicate complex ideas and research using a range of grammatical structures and vocabulary.\n\nAreas for improvement include the use of commas, particularly in longer sentences, and a more consistent use of tenses throughout the paper. Additionally, the writer could benefit from paying closer attention to subject-verb agreement, as there are a few instances where the verb does not match the subject. Overall, with some minor editing and proofreading, the paper has the potential to be a strong research proposal.",

    "prompt": "section 16 :\nwhat goes after \"Token Economics\" section ?\nThe next section after \"Token Economics\" could be a \"Roadmap\" section, which outlines the planned development and implementation of the Eco project and its related technologies. This could include a timeline of key milestones and deliverables, as well as a description of the resources and partnerships that will be necessary to bring the project to fruition. The Roadmap section could also include a discussion of any potential risks or challenges that the project may face, and how these will be addressed.\ncan you provide me the text for \"Troadmap\" with a full technical explanation how this token economics is more viable than others ?\nSure, here is the text for the \"Roadmap\" section:\nRoadmap\nQ1 2023: Launch of the Eco platform and issuance of the Ecosystem Carbon Offset (ECO) token.\nQ2 2023: Onboarding of first group of participating land owners and carbon offset buyers.\nQ3 2023: Integration of precision forestry AI and advanced aerial data analytics for precise digital forest management.\nQ4 2023: Launch of the Eco decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for decentralized governance of the platform.\nQ1 2024: Expansion to international markets and onboarding of additional land owners and carbon offset buyers.\nQ2-Q4 2024: Continual development and improvement of the platform through community-driven decision making within the DAO.\nThis roadmap outlines the key milestones for the development and growth of the Eco platform. In the first quarter of 2023, we will launch the platform and issue the ECO token. In the second quarter, we will onboard our first group of participating land owners and carbon offset buyers. In the third quarter, we will integrate precision forestry AI and advanced aerial data analytics for precise digital forest management. In the fourth quarter, we will launch the Eco DAO for decentralized governance of the platform. In the first quarter of 2024, we will expand to international markets and onboard additional land owners and carbon offset buyers. From the second quarter to the fourth quarter of 2024, we will continually develop and improve the platform through community-driven decision making within the DAO.\nwhat goes after \"roadmap\" section ?\nThe final section of the white paper is the \"Conclusion\" section. This section should summarize the key points made throughout the document and provide a final case for why the project being proposed is viable, desirable, and likely to be successful. The conclusion should leave readers with a clear understanding of the project's goals, its proposed solutions, and the potential benefits it could bring. It should also outline any next steps or future plans for the project, and provide contact information for anyone interested in learning more or getting involved.\ncan you provide me with the text for the \"conclusion\" section?\nCertainly. Here is the text for the conclusion section of the white paper:\n\nConclusion\nIn summary, Eco is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that aims to revolutionize the carbon offset market through the use of blockchain technology and machine learning. By creating a traceability application that utilizes precision forestry AI and advanced aerial data analytics, Eco is able to provide precise digital forest management information and enable the creation of forward carbon reference tokens. These tokens can be used to pay for carbon offset projects, such as planting trees, and provide a verifiable and transparent method for offsetting carbon emissions.\nThe Eco DAO also includes a governance structure in which all participants, including land owners, forest engineers, carbon offset buyers, and solidity coders, can collaborate and make decisions through the use of smart contracts. This ensures that the Eco ecosystem is fully decentralized and self-sustaining.\nOverall, Eco represents a significant advancement in the carbon offset market, providing a superior and scalable solution that utilizes open source code, machine learning, and token economics to create a truly decentralized and autonomous carbon offset registry.\nso in summary how many sections are there in the full whitepaper ?\nThere are 8 sections in the white paper:\nIntroduction\nProblem\nSolution: Carbon Bridge\nTechnology\nEcosystem\nMarket Analysis\nToken Economics\nRoadmap\nConclusion\ncan we also add the blockchain traceability application that tracks the creation of carbon offsets starting form planting seeds to planting seedlings in a field to monitoring the tree growth and count all the way to a full adult tree that can store carbon ?\nSure, we can include a section in the white paper that discusses the blockchain traceability application and how it can be used to track the creation of carbon offsets from planting seeds to fully grown trees. This section could describe the various steps involved in the process, such as planting seeds, seedlings, and monitoring tree growth, and how the traceability application would be used to track each step. It could also describe the benefits of using this type of application, such as increased transparency, improved accuracy, and reduced costs. Finally, this section could compare the traceability application to other existing solutions and explain how it is a more viable option.\ni was thinking of using qr codes to track the process by seed batches and the process nurseries usually use\nSure, you can include a section on the traceability application that you are proposing in the white paper. This application could potentially be a valuable tool for increasing transparency and trust in the carbon offset market. By using QR codes to track the process from seed to tree, you can create a clear and verifiable record of the carbon sequestration process. This could be particularly useful for demonstrating the legitimacy of carbon offset projects to potential buyers and investors. It could also help to ensure that carbon offset credits are being issued accurately and fairly, and that the carbon sequestration process is being carried out in a sustainable and responsible manner.\nhow can we add it to the white paper and under what section will that be ?\nThe traceability application using QR codes could potentially be added to the technology section of the white paper. It could be described as a tool that the DAO is utilizing to accurately track and verify the creation of carbon offsets, starting from the planting of seeds and seedlings, through to the growth and storage of carbon by fully-grown trees. The use of QR codes in the traceability process could be highlighted as a way to efficiently and accurately record and track the progress of the carbon offset projects, ensuring transparency and credibility in the offset creation process.\ncan you add the traceability application using QR codes to the technology section ?\nSure, I can include information about the traceability application using QR codes in the technology section of the white paper. The traceability application using QR codes can help ensure the integrity and authenticity of carbon offset credits by providing a tamper-proof record of each step in the process of creating the offsets, from planting seeds to monitoring tree growth. By using QR codes, the traceability application can provide a quick and efficient way to track the offsets and verify their validity. This can help build trust in the carbon offset market and improve the overall effectiveness of the carbon offset program.\nplease do it\nSure, I can add a section to the white paper discussing the traceability application using QR codes to track the creation of carbon offsets. This section could be included in the Technology section of the white paper, following the section on Smart Contracts.\nThe traceability application using QR codes would work as follows:\nSeeds for trees with high carbon sequestration potential would be sourced and batch-tagged with unique QR codes.\nThe seeds would be planted in nurseries, with each batch of seeds assigned a specific location within the nursery.\nAs the seedlings grow, their progress would be monitored and recorded using the QR code system.\nWhen the seedlings are ready for transplanting to a field, they would be tagged with new QR codes and the location of the field would be recorded.\nThe growth of the trees in the field would continue to be monitored and recorded using the QR code system.\nWhen the trees reach maturity and are able to store significant amounts of carbon, this information would be recorded in the traceability application using the QR code system.\nThis traceability application using QR codes would provide a transparent and verifiable record of the entire process of carbon offset creation, from planting seeds to mature trees able to store carbon. It would be an important tool in the voluntary carbon offset market, as it would provide assurance to buyers that the carbon offsets they are purchasing are legitimate and have been created through a process that is environmentally and socially responsible.\nafter the trees are planted and traced using qr codes can we connect the batch data to the future data skylab will provide by using drones ?\nCertainly, it is possible to incorporate data from Skylab into your traceability application using QR codes. This could be done by linking the data from the QR codes to the data from Skylab's aerial analysis. This could potentially be done through the use of smart contracts, which would allow for automatic updates to the traceability application based on the data from Skylab's drones. This would enable real-time tracking and monitoring of the growth of the trees, and allow for more accurate carbon offset calculations. This could be included in the \"Technology\" section of the white paper, under a subheading discussing the integration of Skylab's data and the traceability application using QR codes.\nplease rewrite the technology page based on what we just discussed and paste the text here\nSure, here is the revised text for the technology section:\n\"Carbon Bridge will utilize blockchain technology to create a decentralized and transparent platform for tracking carbon offsets. This platform will use smart contracts to automate the process of registering, buying, and selling carbon credits, as well as verifying and verifying the validity of offset projects.\nIn addition, Carbon Bridge will employ QR codes to trace the creation of carbon offsets from seed planting to fully grown trees that are able to store carbon. By using QR codes to track the progress of seed batches and the processes used in nurseries, Carbon Bridge will be able to provide a reliable and verifiable record of carbon offset projects.\nTo further enhance the accuracy and precision of our data, Carbon Bridge will also partner with companies like Skylab, which provide precision forestry AI and advanced aerial data analytics. By incorporating Skylab's data on digital forest management, Carbon Bridge will be able to provide even more detailed and accurate information on the carbon storage capabilities of offset projects.\nOverall, the use of blockchain technology and QR codes, combined with partnerships with companies like Skylab, will allow Carbon Bridge to create a reliable, verifiable, and transparent platform for carbon offset trading.\"\ncan you rewrite it with more details on how the qr code will incorporate with skylab and drones to provide even more traceability on how accurate these carbon offsets data will be ?\nSure, here is a revised version of the technology section of the white paper that includes the traceability application using QR codes and the integration with Skylab's precision forestry technology and drones:\nTechnology\nEco will use blockchain technology to create a decentralized and transparent registry for carbon offset credits. By using smart contracts and machine learning, Eco will be able to accurately and efficiently verify and track the creation of carbon offsets from the planting of seeds all the way to the fully grown trees that are able to store carbon.\nTo further enhance the traceability of the carbon offset credits, Eco will implement the use of QR codes. Each batch of seeds will be assigned a unique QR code, which will be used to track the progress of the seeds as they are grown in nurseries and planted in the field. The QR code data will be recorded on the blockchain, ensuring that the entire process is transparent and verifiable.\nIn addition to the traceability provided by the QR codes, Eco will also integrate with Skylab's precision forestry technology and advanced aerial data analytics. Using drones, Skylab will be able to provide detailed and accurate information on the growth and health of the trees. This data will be used to further verify the carbon offset credits and ensure their accuracy.\nBy combining the traceability of the QR codes with the precision forestry technology from Skylab, Eco will be able to create a highly reliable and verifiable system for carbon offset credits. This will be a significant improvement over traditional carbon offset certification bodies, which often rely on manual and subjective processes that can be prone to errors and fraud.\nwill it be useful if we can have the drone pilots do counting and monitoring the trees heath on quarterly basis or twice a year if yes will that be a bounty that the forward carbon offset buyer can submit to the community ?\nYes, it could be useful to have the drone pilots count and monitor the trees on a regular basis, as this would provide ongoing data on the health and growth of the trees. This data could be used to update the carbon offset measurements and ensure that they are accurate.",

    "prompt": "This is part 3 of my multiple messages. I will continue to send you further messages. If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\". Grounds of appeal\n\nThe appeal from the costs order was filed within time on 11 December 2020.\n\nThe notice of appeal identified the following as grounds of appeal, either as errors of law, or as errors of fact and law, or errors of fact, for which leave to appeal was sought:\n\nThe Tribunal did not give adequate reasons.\n\nTribunal erred in awarding costs against the appellant who consented to the first respondent's transfer application.\n\nThe Tribunal erred in awarding costs to the second respondent who did no more than consent to the transfer.\n\nThe Tribunal erred in the bases in its sixth reason set out above and in the assumption in its third reason that the appellant had obtained quantum evidence exceeding $500,000 before filing. This also did not take into account the processes for an owners corporation to consider and decide to limit its claim to the jurisdictional cap.\n\nThere was no basis for the finding that the claim should not have been brought in the Tribunal (this related to the fourth and fifth of the primary member's reasons).\n\nTo leave the costs order standing would discourage claims being brought in the Tribunal, would contravene the guiding principle in CATA s 36 and encourage respondents' transfer applications \"on the basis that the first party who seeks a transfer was awarded costs\".\n\nIf leave was required, there was said to be a substantial miscarriage of justice \"in circumstances where a judgment for a significant sum has been made against [the appellant] based upon incorrect information\".\n\nThe notice of appeal sought that the primary order should be varied to make costs of the primary proceedings including the transfer costs in the Supreme Court claim costs in the cause. Additionally, the appellant claimed costs of the appeal.\n\nApplicable legal principles\n\nCATA s 80 provides as follows:\n\n\"(1) An appeal against an internally appealable decision may be made to an Appeal Panel by a party to the proceedings in which the decision is made.\n\nNote. Internal appeals are required to be heard by the Tribunal constituted as an Appeal Panel. See section 27(1).\n\n(2) Any internal appeal may be made \u2014\n\n(a) in the case of an interlocutory decision of the Tribunal at first instance\u2014with the leave of the Appeal Panel, and\n\n(b) in the case of any other kind of decision (including an ancillary decision) of the Tribunal at first instance\u2014as of right on any question of law, or with the leave of the Appeal Panel, on any other grounds.\n\n(3) The Appeal Panel may \u2014\n\n(a) decide to deal with the internal appeal by way of a new hearing if it considers that the grounds for the appeal warrant a new hearing, and\n\n(b) permit such fresh evidence, or evidence in addition to or in substitution for the evidence received by the Tribunal at first instance, to be given in the new hearing as it considers appropriate in the circumstances.\"\n\nClause 12 of Schedule 4 to CATA states:\n\n\"An Appeal Panel may grant leave under section 80 (2) (b) of this Act for an internal appeal against a Division decision only if the Appeal Panel is satisfied the appellant may have suffered a substantial miscarriage of justice because:\n\n(a) the decision of the Tribunal under appeal was not fair and equitable, or\n\n(b) the decision of the Tribunal under appeal was against the weight of evidence, or\n\n(c) significant new evidence has arisen (being evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the proceedings under appeal were being dealt with).\"\n\nA Division decision is a primary decision of the Consumer and Commercial Division. The primary decision here is such a decision.\n\nCATA s 4(1) contains the following relevant definitions to the nature of the decision from which an appeal is brought:\n\n\"ancillary decision of the Tribunal means a decision made by the Tribunal under legislation (other than an interlocutory decision of the Tribunal) that is preliminary to, or consequential on, a decision determining proceedings, including\u2014\n\n(a) a decision concerning whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to deal with a matter, and\n\n(b) a decision concerning the awarding of costs in proceedings.\"\n\n\"'interlocutory decision' of the Tribunal means a decision made by the Tribunal under legislation concerning any of the following\u2014\n\n(a) the granting of a stay or adjournment,\n\n(b) the prohibition or restriction of the disclosure, broadcast or publication of matters,\n\n(c) the issue of a summons,\n\n(d) the extension of time for any matter (including for the lodgment of an application or appeal),\n\n(e) an evidential matter,\n\n(f) the disqualification of any member,\n\n(g) the joinder or misjoinder of a party to proceedings,\n\n(h) the summary dismissal of proceedings,\n\n(h1) the granting of leave for a person to represent a party to proceedings,\n\n(i) any other interlocutory issue before the Tribunal.\"\n\nIn Ericon Buildings PL v Owners SP 96597 [2020] NSWCATAP 265 at [26] the Appeal Panel, in the course of refusing leave to appeal a procedural order, focused at [9]-[10] on the required connection of an ancillary decision with a decision determining proceedings, not a decision which the party alleged should have been made to determine the proceedings. In that case, the orders under appeal noted a consent to judgment that had not been accepted by the applicant and set a timetable for a foreshadowed transfer application on which the transfer could be contested on the basis there was a tender of the maximum amount of the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Those orders were found to be interlocutory in character and therefore to require leave to appeal under CATA s 80(2)(a). Leave to appeal was refused at [13]-[18] because no decision that was said to be in error had actually been made; \"for completeness\", the Panel expressed the view at [19]-[27] that the Tribunal would be entitled to take into account the possibility that the Tribunal's jurisdiction on a work order was not limited to a value of $500,000 and at [28]-[36] that there was no tender of the Tribunal's maximum jurisdiction of $500,000 by actual payment.\n\nThe Ericon characterisation is consistent with the orthodox test, implicit in the statutory definitions cited above, that an interlocutory decision does not finally determine the rights of the parties in respect of the relief claimed in the proceedings: see, eg, Sanofi v Parke Davis PL [No 1] (1982) 149 CLR 147 at 152.\nA question of law may include, not only an error in ascertaining the legal principle or in applying it to the facts of the case, but also taking into account an irrelevant consideration or not taking into account a relevant consideration, which includes not making a finding on an ingredient or central issue required to make out a claimed entitlement to relief: see CEO of Customs v AMI Toyota Ltd (2000) 102 FCR 578 (Full Fed Ct), [2000] FCA 1343 at [45], applying the statement of principle in Craig v South Australia (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179.\nThese categories are not exhaustive of errors of law that give rise to an appeal as of right. In Prendergast v Western Murray Irrigation Ltd [2014] NSWCATAP 69 at [13], the Appeal Panel enunciated the following as specifically included:\n\nwhether the Tribunal provided adequate reasons;\n\nwhether the Tribunal identified the wrong issue or asked the wrong question;\n\nwhether it applied a wrong principle of law;\n\nwhether there was a failure to afford procedural fairness;\n\nwhether the Tribunal failed to take into account a relevant (that is, a mandatory) consideration;\n\nwhether it took into account an irrelevant consideration;\n\nwhether there was no evidence to support a finding of fact; and\n\nwhether the decision was legally unreasonable.\n\nIn relation to adequacy of reasons, it is essential to expose the reasons for resolving a point critical to the contest between the parties: Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) PL (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 (CA) at 259, 270-272, 280-281; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Palme (2003) 216 CLR 212 at [40]; Wainohu v NSW (2011) 243 CLR 181 at [58]; NSW Land and Housing Corp v Orr (2019) 100 NSWLR 578, [2019] NSWCA 231 at [65]-[77]; CATA s 62(3).\n\nA failure to deal with evidence may also in the appropriate circumstances be characterised as a failure to have regard to a relevant consideration or a failure to have regard to critical evidence. It is generally not mandatory to consider particular evidence: Rodger v De Gelder (2015) 71 MVR 514, [2015] NSWCA 211 at [86]; Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd v Cervantes (2012) 61 MVR 443, [2012] NSWCA 244 at [15] per Basten JA (McColl and Macfarlan JJA agreeing). However, by s 38(6)(a) of the CATA, the Tribunal \u201cis to ensure that all relevant material is disclosed to the Tribunal so as to enable it to determine all of the relevant facts in issue in any proceedings.\u201d This obligation includes an obligation to have regard to material which has been disclosed to the Tribunal and which is relevant to the facts in issue, at least where that material is of some significance. Further, at common law, where a decision-maker ignores evidence which is critical to an issue in a case and contrary to an assertion of fact made by one party and accepted by the decision-maker, this is an error of law because the reasons are thereby rendered inadequate: Mifsud v Campbell (1991) 21 NSWLR 725 at 728; Pollard v RRR Corporation Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 110 at [62]-[63]; Eadie v Harvey [2017] NSWCATAP 201 at [61]-[62].\n\nThe \u201cno evidence\" ground must identify that there is no, or substantially inadequate, evidence to support a \u201ccritical\u201d or an \u201cultimate\u201d fact in order to constitute a jurisdictional error (a form of error of law): AAI Ltd t/as GIO v McGiffen (2016) 77 MVR 34, [2016] NSWCA 229 at [81]; Jegatheeswaran v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs (2001) 194 ALR 263, [2001] FCA 865 at [52]-[56].\n\nLegal unreasonableness can be concluded if the Panel comes to the view that no reasonable tribunal could have reached the primary decision on the material before it: Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 KB 223 at 230; Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Li (2013) 249 CLR 332, [2013] HCA 18 at 364 [68]. A failure properly to exercise a statutory discretion may be legally unreasonable if, upon the facts, the result is unreasonable or plainly unjust: Li at 367 [76]. There is an analogy with the principle in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499, [1936] HCA 40 at 505 that an appellate court may infer that there has been a failure properly to exercise a discretion \u201cif upon the facts [the result] is unreasonable or plainly unjust\u201d and with legal unreasonableness as a ground of judicial review: Li at 367 [76].\n\nTurning to errors of fact, in Collins v Urban [2014] NSWCATAP 17, after an extensive review from [65] onwards, an Appeal Panel stated at [76]\u2013[79] and [84(2)] as follows:\n\n\u201c74 Accordingly, it should be accepted that a substantial miscarriage of justice may have been suffered because of any of the circumstances referred to in cl 12(1)(a), (b) or (c) where there was a \"significant possibility\" or a \"chance which was fairly open\" that a different and more favourable result would have been achieved for the appellant had the relevant circumstance in para (a) or (b) not occurred or if the fresh evidence under para (c) had been before the Tribunal at first instance.\n\n75 As to the particular grounds in cl 12(1)(a) and (b), without seeking to be exhaustive in any way, the authorities establish that:\n\n1 If there has been a denial of procedural fairness the decision under appeal can be said to have been \"not fair and equitable\" - Hutchings v CTTT [2008] NSWSC 717 at [35], Atkinson v Crowley [2011] NSWCA 194 at [12].\n\n2 The decision under appeal can be said to be \"against the weight of evidence\" (which is an expression also used to describe a ground upon which a jury verdict can be set aside) where the evidence in its totality preponderates so strongly against the conclusion found by the tribunal at first instance that it can be said that the conclusion was not one that a reasonable tribunal member could reach - Calin v The Greater Union Organisation Pty Ltd (1991) 173 CLR 33 at 41-42, Mainteck Services Pty Limited v Stein Heurtey SA [2013] NSWSC 266 at [153].\n\n\u2026",

    "prompt": "Please fix this essay: Jane Eyre (Argument) In \u201cJane Eyre\u201d we are introduced to a girl that is faced with a lot of challenges. These challenges influence her in many ways to her decisions that she has made throughout the novel. Going from facing her parent\u2019s death and growing up as an orphan who is raised by a cruel aunt, to growing up learning how to raise herself and find happiness through rough times. Even dealing with the decision of possibly having to let go of the man she is in love with because of his dishonesty. Most of all she is challenged in choosing what is more important to her to stay independent or to kill her loneliness with a man that she is in love with named Rochester, with the risks of him being a false appearance to what she met him as. The difference between loneliness and independence for Jane is loneliness is her feeling of emotions that helps her achieve independence which is providing for herself, and creating stability to seek happiness. Jane is being raised at a place called Gateshead by the Reed\u2019s, a very wealthy family. She is sent there by her kind uncle Reed after her parents die from a disease called typhus. While she is there she is mistreated by her cruel aunt Reed. When a fight breaks out between a cousin and her she is punished for throwing a book at his face and is blamed for the cause of it. Her aunt places her in a room referred to as the \u201cred room\u201d where her uncle dies, and while she is in there she believes that she sees his ghostly spirit and it frightens her into a shock and she passes out. This sets Jane off and she is facing a problem with feeling that she is singled out in the family and wants to neglect them because of her mistreating. Although there are some people who are nicer to her that work in Gateshead, her aunt gives her a title of being a liar from all the false statements that Jane makes to them. I believe that she is feeling this way because she has lost respect for her aunt Reed and really wants to neglect her. Jane says \u201cI am glad that you are no relation of mine. I will never call you aunt again as long as I live. I will never come to visit you 2 when I am grown up; and if anyone asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with miserable cruelty.\u201d (95) Mrs. Reed\u2019s reaction was shocking, but Jane was entitled to her own opinion and that is how she felt about her aunt that promised to take good care of her when her parents were dying. Jane\u2019s actions show that she wants to leave and she already has her mind made up that she is going to leave but doesn\u2019t know when. This is the set off to Jane and her structuring life to growing up being independent. Jane is struck with news that she will be sent off to school to a place called Lowood. She meets a seemingly nice principal named Mr. Brocklehurst before attending and she thinks that this is going to be the beginning of a possible happy life until she arrives and sees otherwise. Jane quickly meets a girl that she becomes really close with at Lowood that sticks with her through humiliation that she goes through at school named Helen. When Helen lets her know that the school she is at is a school for charity maintained for female orphans, you can imagine the thoughts that were going through her head that she was not wanted at Gateshead. She is a young girl that just feels alone in the world that she lives in. This influenced her to grow up being independent as well, with the guidance of her strong faith in God and her religion to keep her going. She uses her faith as guidance to where she will continue her life and move forward to what she feels God wants her to do. While she was at school the Reed\u2019s sent a message with the Principal that Jane was a compulsive liar and that she was pretty much unmoral. Jane realizes that she is at a really strict school and when a event happened that Jane was accused for Mr. Brocklehurst put Jane on a pedal stool and told everyone that she was a liar and to not associate with her. Though Helen stuck with her and attempted to lift her spirits telling her that most of the girls felt pittier for her than looking at her as guilt Jane still feels alone. 3 When Helen soon dies from consumption Jane is further more upset than anything and feels that it is not meant for her to have anyone close in her life. Jane quotes to herself \u201cI remembered descending that hill at twilight: an age seemed to have elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood; and I had never quitted it since. My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had ever been to visit me. I had no communication by letter or message with the outer world.\u201d(151) Jane is reminiscing her past and this is symbolizing her loneliness, she is further more believing that it is meant for her to be alone in the world that she is living in and that her independence was created from this. The difference of her feeling alone is to fulfill her happiness and her independence is to assure herself that she can still make it without depending on anyone. She grows in to a woman that wants to have her own stableness. What\u2019s bizarre about this quality of Jane is that she lives in a era that women do not work to have their own stableness unless they inherit it. Women were known to depend on their husband to take care of them and their families. Later Jane grows up and moves away from Lowood to a place called Thornfield where she is starting her life and tutors a girl named Adele. While she is there, she is introduced to a man named Rochester who is uncharacteristic when he first meets her, but eventually pulls the attention out of Jane with his strong personality. Jane eventually finds herself attracted and falling for Rochester after saving his life from a fire. \u201cAnd was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes? No, reader: gratitude, and many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the brightest fire.\u201d(220) she is showing that her feelings for Rochester is there and even though she may have seen some faults in him the actual attention she had from him made her feel wanted. Something that she has 4 not felt in a long time, the fact that it was an event that caught her off guard she refuses to let her guard down immediately but she will cherish the moments she gets from his attention. The feeling of being lonely has started to fade and she realizes that the attention she gets from him makes her feel happy. \u201cBut I believed that his moodiness, his harshness, and former faults of morality had their source in some cruel cross of fate. I believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies, higher principles, and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed, education instilled, or destiny encouraged.\u201d(220) I believe that this is faith in Jane\u2019s personality, and the past that she came from where people who has mistreated her had never gave her the time or belief that they had a better side of them. Rochester with some faults still has a better side and can still cheer her up with just associating makes him potentially tolerant to Jane. Jane has the ability to consider Rochester\u2019s faults because she mentions when talking to herself that she would be willing to satisfy his grief, whenever he might be moody she has the heart of a teddy bear. \u201cI cannot deny that I grieved for his grief, whatever that was, and would have given much to assuage it.\u201d (220) Why would someone who has never been treated good by someone she loved be willing to fix what she does not necessarily like? Jane\u2019s feign for happiness is followed by her obsession of attention and satisfying from the absent of loneliness which Rochester shows her these qualities. Meanwhile as Jane is asked to join a party that is filled with elegant and aristocratic guest. Blanche Ingram and her mother are ahead of the party members and they treat Jane with distain and cruelty, Jane does not take this well and leaves in tears before she is stopped by Rochester who catches her down emotions. He lets her leave because she is upset but he tells her that he wants her to come by the drawing room every evening during his guests company at Thornfield. \u201c Well, to-night I excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect you to appear in the drawing-room every evening: it is 5 my wish; don\u2019t neglect it. Now go, and send Sophie for Adele. Goodnight my ---\u201c He stopped, bit his lip, and abruptly left me.\u201d (259) I believe Jane catches on to this as she might have enjoyed this ever more than she speaks right away. Jane knows that Rochester is showing affection and cares about her and to see her on a everyday occasion. This is the affection that makes Jane feel less lonely and makes her happy inside. Jane desperately travels back to Gateshead when she hears her aunt Reed is dying, while she is there she is presented with a old letter and news that she has family that wants to adopt her and share with her some of their wealth, that she later gets in the novel. She is away for a couple of months and gets news that Rochester had went to buy a new carriage, something intended for a marriage. Jane\u2019s feelings for Rochester are addressed more by the narrator when she returns back to Thornfield. She shocks herself when she expresses to Rochester how she missed him while they were away from each other. \u201cThank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness. I am strangely glad to get back to you; and wherever you are is my home, my home only home.\u201d (330) This is an example of Jane\u2019s happiness from the presence of Rochester. She feels that she is no longer lonely when it comes to people she is encountered with. Although her independence still takes place when she has taken it upon herself to travel to Gateshead alone and see her aunt Reed that dies. Jane\u2019s faith in God fortunately guides her to finding out that she has family that she eventually inherits wealth from. Post acceptance to Rochester\u2019s proposal she contacts her uncle John Eyre and lets him know of her wedding. John makes Jane his heir and she is now equal footing to Rochester. This makes Jane more comfortable to marrying Rochester, and satisfies her doubts that the wedding possibly will not happen. \u201cDo you remember what you said of Celine Varens? Of the diamonds, the cashmeres you gave her? I will not be your English Celine Varens. I shall continue to act as Adele\u2019s governess: by that I shall earn my board and lodging, and thirty 6 pounds a year besides. I\u2019ll furnish my own wardrobe out of that money, and you shall give me nothing but.\u201d (356) Jane\u2019s independence is shown here when she expresses to Rochester that she will not marry him until she is able to have her own stability. She uses a lady that Rochester had encounters with in the past that he nourished, and she explicitly says that she will not be that woman; that she will not depend on Rochester. Jane\u2019s pride has made her more compelling to Rochester and it makes his love for her stronger. Awaiting their marriage another tragic event happens that postpones the wedding even longer. While there was a first attempt to a wedding, Rochester strangely tries to resume the ceremony as someone quickly interrupts and rejects why they should get married. Rochester is confronted with the news and proof that he was still married to another woman named Bertha. While they crowd was invited to see why she was kept a secret Jane departures herself for a while until she recovers. While this crazy event was happening Jane picked up her inherited five thousand pounds that was split between her and her cousins. Rochester is blinded by a fire that happens at Thornfield when it is burned down and his legally married wife Bertha was killed in that fire attempting to kill Rochester. Jane is left with twenty thousand pounds when her uncle John dies and eventually gets back to Rochester. With the drama that has diluted and faded away Jane and Rochester picked up where they stopped and ends up getting married. It is important to know that Rochester lost a hand and his eyesight and she still seeks the love she had for him. Jane and Rochester had been married happily for ten years, after two years in to their marriage they have a baby boy and Rochester claims to be getting his sight back in one eye when he says he is able to see their son when he holds him for the first time. Jane completes a life of struggle and tough challenges through faith and pride. Her belief in God and using his guidance lead her to a life that she never thought she would have growing 7 up as a little girl. She survives through her times of loneliness and provides herself with the ability to be independent to seek happiness. Jane shows the definition and the difference of loneliness and independence. She uses her feelings of emotions to motivate her to achieve independence by assuring that she will be able provide for herself before she completes her life with happiness. She seeks happiness when she realizes that she has love in her life but refuses to take the offer of love until she was able to create stability by being independent in the process. Jane ends up being of more fortune of Rochester and still being able to have the love she wanted with him by sticking with her faith and pride and guidance from the love of God. The story and rough journey of Jane Eyre, ends up being the happy Jane Rochester.",
    "answer": "In Jane Eyre, the protagonist faces many challenges that shape her decisions throughout the novel. Growing up as an orphan raised by a cruel aunt, and then having to find happiness and stability on her own, she is faced with the difficult decision of whether to stay independent or give into loneliness by pursuing a relationship with Mr. Rochester, despite his dishonesty. The distinction between loneliness and independence is important to Jane, as loneliness is an emotional state she experiences, while independence means providing for herself and creating stability.\n\nAs a child, Jane is sent to live with the wealthy Reed family after her parents die. While there, she is mistreated by her aunt and feels singled out in the family. Despite the kindness of some of the servants, Jane feels that she has lost respect for her aunt and wants to leave. After being sent to school at Lowood, Jane meets Helen, a girl who becomes her close friend and helps her through the humiliations she faces at the school. However, when Helen dies from consumption, Jane feels more alone than ever. Her experiences at Lowood, along with her strong faith in God, shape her into a woman who desires stability and independence.\n\nDespite living in a time when women are expected to depend on their husbands for support, Jane grows into a woman who wants to have her own stability and success. She eventually leaves Lowood and takes on various jobs, eventually becoming a governess at Thornfield Hall. It is there that she meets Mr. Rochester and falls in love with him, but their relationship is complicated by his secret. In the end, Jane chooses to stay true to herself and her values, ultimately finding happiness and independence on her own terms.\n\nOverall, the challenges that Jane faces throughout the novel shape her into a strong and independent woman who values her own happiness and stability above all else.",

Paragraph summary: This paper looks at two specific hormones: LH and hCG. Both have important roles within ovulation and were thought to be almost interchangeable. Once technology advanced and evolved, researchers were able to study both hormones with better accuracy. Scientists thought this because they share a common receptor, however, this paper explains that there are many differences between these two hormones. The main difference is how they affect the signalling cascade for ovulation. The paper also mentions the hormone GnRH and how it affects LH and hCG. One example of this was when it provided research done on how a GnRH receptor blockade affects LH levels. The differences between LH and hCG were heavily discussed. For instance, the paper provides a diagram and explained how both hormones bind to the same receptor. Finally, the paper gives a brief discussion on what these differences mean for new treatments. Infertility could be treated now that professionals know about these differences a lot better. \n\n3. The usefulness of the reference: This reference was somewhat useful. It provided in depth and incredibly information on the structure, function, and effects of LH. However, how GnRH affects this process was barely discussed. There was some research that was talked about, but It wasn\u2019t enough to expand my knowledge on GnRH a significant amount. For people wanting to learn about hCG and LH, this paper is great at explaining their similarities and differences. However, that is what most of the paper is focused on, so any other information will need to be found elsewhere. \n\n4.

Paragraph summary: Hole\u2019s Essentials of Human Anatomy and Physiology provides a basic summary of the processes that GnRH and luteinizing hormone cause. For example, it explains how GnRh is released from the hypothalamus, and GnRH signals the pituitary gland to secrete LH. LH is used to help ovarian cells produce estrogen. The passage includes other hormones and pathways that cause estrogen to be released. FSH was one such hormone. After explaining the hormones that start the process, the book continues talking about the effects estrogen has. Eventually, it elaborates on the process that lead up to ovulation. Finally, it concludes with explaining how estrogen leads to the inhibition of both LH and FSH. Without directly stating it, the passage explains how GnRH, LH, and estrogen are a negative feedback loop. GnRH stimulates LH which stimulates estrogen. Estrogen then inhibits both GnRH and LH. When estrogen levels eventually lower, both GnRH and LH can be produced. This is how the reproductive cycle of females works. \n\n3. The usefulness of the reference: This reference was extremely useful. It not only explains the interactions that the hormones have on each other, but it also talks about the effects it has on the body. I find this helpful because I didn\u2019t know much on ovulation, so a more in depth explanation of what happens during the process helps immensely. Even outside of this project, this passage provides great surface level knowledge into the topic of ovulation. I would recommend this to someone who needs a starting source on the topic of ovulation. \n\n4.

Paragraph summary: This article discusses gender identity and how humans are taking steps to help the issue. Children who were born biologically male or female may undergo puberty through the wrong body parts. For example, a biological female may go through puberty and testosterone is being produced. These children have to deal with the fact that they live in a body that doesn\u2019t feel natural to them. An option to help the problem is mentioned within the passage. There is a treatment that stops the hormone signalling that causes puberty by regulating GnRH, but the RDA did not approve of it. The treatment that is in use is by using hormone blockers to artificially delay puberty. Suicide rates are higher for people with this issue, and it\u2019s possible that over three million Americans are affected by this. This is why the article makes it clear that there needs to be more progress made in this area. There have been concerns about long term effects such as lowered bone density, infertility, and brain growth. However, no evidence has been presented that proves that any of these are actual effects. \n\n3. The usefulness of the reference: For my personal use, this article is only slightly useful. It does give insight into other scenarios where the hormone pathway that causes puberty is messed up. However, it talks more about the problem and how people are dealing with it than why the hormone pathway is wrong in the first place. It was somewhat useful when the article talked about the health effects of hormone blockers because that could be correlated to the hormones in some way. The article never did correlate it back to the hormones, so all I could do was speculate. This is why I don\u2019t find it extremely useful. That information would be much more beneficial to me than information on children\u2019s hospital that helps these children. For other people, it is a great introduction into the topic of delaying puberty and children who don\u2019t identity if their biological sex. But, that is really the only thing this article can be used for.. \n\n4. Defined vocabulary and key ideas:\n\u201cexperts say there's a fifty-fifty chance your child will attempt suicide before age 20\u201d\n\u201cThe treatment--a series of injections to interrupt the brain cascade that launches puberty by regulating gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)--has not yet been submitted for FDA approval for gender-variant children.\u201d\n\u201cThere isn't enough evidence yet to determine the long-term effects of artificially delayed puberty, but the FDA has noted no serious side effects in the nearly 20 years hormone blockers have been used in the U.S. to treat early-onset puberty in the short term.\u201d\n\u201cIf a child doesn't identify with his or her biological sex, the onset of puberty, says Laura Amato, a youth-suicide counselor who runs an online transgender support group, can make that child feel like \"part of a real-life horror story . . . because the wrong parts are changing.\"\u201d\n\n\nEncyclopedia\n1.

First, it explains what the purpose of each is within the human body. For example, the passage explains that LH stimulates testosterone production and sperm maturation in males and theca cells to produce androgens in females. After each has been explained thoroughly, it talks about the feedback loops associated with these hormones. Specifically, the negative feedback loop between GnRH, LH, and FSH and sex steriods. These steroids can mess with how GnRH is released which in turn affects the production of Lh and FSH. Finally, the encyclopedia continues on with explaining how estrogen is affected and ovulation. It explains that estrogen promotes GnRH and LH which leads to ovulation. Also, it describes some of the different subunits to the structures of the proteins. These subunits are important in inhibiting secretion. However, LH levels are not affected by this inhibiting. \n3. The usefulness of the reference: This encyclopedia was fairly helpful. I was able to expand and build upon the foundation that other sources had provided for me on this topic. There were not many other sources that discussed the feedback loops as much as this encyclopedia, so that is why it was so helpful. For other people looking to learn about ovulation, this encyclopedia provides enough information to understand it at a surface level. It doesn;t really deviate from the topic, and if anything, expands the topic even more. \n\n4.

This is a test to measure the amount of LH in a person\u2019s blood. First, the video explains what exactly LH causes. For females, ovulation for eggs, and for males, testosterone production. Then, it explains why someone would need to take an LH test. Some of the reasons are to detect when ovulation will take place or if there is a low sperm count. Next, it provides a nice diagram of the progression of signalling that happens. First, GnRH is released from the hypothalamus and signals the Anterior Pituitary to release LH. LH will then go to the testis (male) or ovaries (female). Finally, the video explains the results that a normal LH test should give. The results can vary in females depending on where they are in the menstrual cycle. The video ends with how different levels of LH affect the body of men and men and provides some drugs that can help change these levels. \n\n3. The usefulness of the reference: This reference is fairly useful. The video more so focuses on LH tests and how those results can be interpreted rather than the hormones or ovulation. However, this video did help me understand the basics of ovulation and the hormones involved. I was also given information about LH tests that could be useful later even if it is not apparent right now. This video is great for someone needing more information on LH tests, but I feel there are better sources that focus on ovulation and the hormones involved more. \n\n4.

    "answer": "Introduction:\n\nEstrogen is a molecule that plays a crucial role in regulating the female reproductive cycle. This paper will argue that estrogen is the most important molecule in regulating the female reproductive cycle by providing evidence from various sources. In this paper, we will discuss the role of estrogen in the female reproductive cycle, the hormones that are responsible for the production of estrogen, and the effects of estrogen on the reproductive cycle.\n\nRole of Estrogen in the Female Reproductive Cycle:\n\nEstrogen is a steroid hormone that is responsible for the development and maintenance of secondary sexual characteristics in females. It plays a vital role in the regulation of the menstrual cycle and ovulation. According to Shier, Butler, & Lewis (2005) in their book Hole's Essentials of Human Anatomy and Physiology, \"estrogen leads to the inhibition of both LH and FSH\" (p. 677). This means that when estrogen levels are high, the production of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is inhibited, which in turn leads to the inhibition of ovulation.\n\nHormones Responsible for the Production of Estrogen:\n\nThe primary hormones responsible for the production of estrogen are luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). According to Shier, Butler, & Lewis (2005), LH and FSH are released from the pituitary gland in response to the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. LH is responsible for stimulating the ovarian cells to produce estrogen. FSH, on the other hand, is responsible for stimulating the growth of the follicles in the ovary, which leads to the production of estrogen.\n\nEffects of Estrogen on the Reproductive Cycle:\n\nEstrogen plays a critical role in the regulation of the menstrual cycle and ovulation. According to Shier, Butler, & Lewis (2005), high levels of estrogen lead to the inhibition of LH and FSH, which in turn leads to the inhibition of ovulation. As estrogen levels decrease, both GnRH and LH can be produced, leading to ovulation.\n\nFurthermore, as discussed in the paper by Choi and Smitz (2014), LH and hCG have disparate effects on downstream signaling cascades. \"LH and hCG are widely recognized for their roles in ovulation and the support of early pregnancy\" (Choi & Smitz, 2014, p. 203) However, the authors explained that \"emerging evidence suggests that LH and hCG have disparate effects on downstream signaling cascades\" (Choi & Smitz, 2014, p. 203) This means that LH and hCG have different effects on the signaling cascade for ovulation, and this difference is important for new treatments.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, this paper has argued that estrogen is the most important molecule in regulating the female reproductive cycle. We have discussed the role of estrogen in the female reproductive cycle, the hormones that are responsible for the production of estrogen, and the effects of estrogen on the reproductive cycle. Estrogen plays a critical role in the regulation of the menstrual cycle and ovulation and its production is regulated by LH, FSH and GnRH. Additionally, the differences between LH and hCG have also been discussed, highlighting their importance in the signaling cascade for ovulation. With this understanding, new treatments can be developed to address conditions such as infertility.",

    "prompt": "most concern single-plant herbal or phytomedicine (www.thecochranelibrary.com). In recent years, in the case of multicomponent herbal medicines, an increased number of RCTs on traditional herbal med- icine has been reported in the literature (World Health Organization 2004). For example, an Australian study on a Chinese herbal medicine prescription for the treatment of allergic rhinitis concluded that level II evidence is available that may substantiate the use of Chinese herbal medicine for both seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis (Xue et al. 2003). Unfortunately, the quality of the majority of the clini- cal studies of herbal medicines reported to date is of great concern due to a number of factors that have rendered the data of dubious value. In a review of 206 RCTs on herbal medicine, which was published in Medline from 1966 to 2003, important methodological components of RCTs, particularly alloca- tion concealment, generation of the allocation sequences, and intention-to-treat analyses, were incom- pletely reported. In these studies, only slightly over a quarter of the trials adequately reported blinding, and one-fifth reported generation of random allocation sequences (Gagnier et al. 2006). Furthermore, an earlier review of 2938 RCTs on TCM reported in 1980\u20131997 (Tang, Zhan, and Ernst 1999) con- cluded that the majority of these studies suffered from methodological defects. For example, only 15% of these studies used blinding, the sample size was mostly less than 300 patients, the controls were inadequate, few studies used quantitative outcome measures, and the studies were short term.\nThere have been many nonclinical in vitro and in vivo studies on herbal medicines that have commonly supported the traditional therapeutic claims. However, systematic reviews of the study protocols or the data interpretation and validation are lacking. Further, the translation of an in vitro and/or in vivo biological/pharmacological effect of a herbal medicine to human therapeutic use may not be successful due to species differences or other mitigating circumstances, including the simple attribute of a biological or clinical outcome by the name of the mother herb, while neglecting the type of plant extract, methods of processing, and pharmaceutical formulation, which invariably contain varying content and proportions of active chemical components (Brinker 2009).\nIn addition to the preclinical biological or pharmacological issues, the quality of the herbal prod- ucts can affect the clinical outcomes and thus can impact their successful integration into EBM. Herbal medicine quality can be substantially different due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Species differences, organ specificity, and diurnal and seasonal variations are examples of intrinsic fac- tors that can affect the qualitative and quantitative accumulation of the biologically or pharmaco- logically active chemical constituents produced and/or accumulated in the herb. Extrinsic factors affecting the quality of the herbal medicine include environmental conditions, cultivation and field collection practices, postharvest handling, storage, manufacturing, inadvertent contamination, sub- stitution, and intentional adulteration (Awang 1997; Huang, Wen, and Hsiao 1997; Slifman et al. 1998; Mahady, Fong, and Farnsworth 2001; Cordell 2002; Fong 2002; Chadwick and Fong 2006).\n22.3 FACTORS RELEVANT TO/AFFECTING INTEGRATION OF HERBAL MEDICINE INTO MODERN MEDICAL PRACTICES\n\nA range of interrelated quality, safety and efficacy issues could contribute to the rational and successful integration of herbal medicine into modern medical practices.\n22.3.1 Herb QualIty Issues\n\nFundamental to assuring the efficacy and reproducibility of any medicinal agent, be it a single chemical or a complex herbal mixture, is the assured quality of the product. In the case of single chemical drugs, the quality and properties are well defined and documented in pharmacopoeias or on file with regulatory agencies or marketing authorities. On the other hand, herbal medicines, be they single herbs or polyherbal products, suffer from a lack of uniformity in their chemical and physical qualities due to various factors as mentioned above. All these factors have contributed to extensive lists of herbal medicines being reported in the scientific and lay media to be of inferior and questionable quality and authenticity.\n \n456 Herbal Medicine: Biomolecular and Clinical Aspects\n\nIn our early postmarket surveillance of selected commercial ginseng products prepared from Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer., P. quinquefolius L., and Eleutherococcus senticosus Max (eleuthero) marketed in North America in 1995\u20131998, we found that 26% of these products did not meet label claims with respect to the claimed ginsenoside content of the Panax ginseng and Panax quinquefo- lius products (Fitzloff, Yat, and Lu 1998). Studies on the quality of St. John\u2019s wort products showed the hypericin content ranging from 22% to 165% and silymarin content in milk thistle (Silybum marianum L. Gaertn.) products ranging from 58% to 116% of the labeled claims (Schulz, Hubner, and Ploch 1997). Gilroy et al. (2003) reported their investigation of herbal medicines sold as \u201cechi- nacea\u201d in the United States. A total of 59 products were studied (Gilroy et al. 2003) and of these, seven of nine so-called standardized products contained substantially less of the marker compounds echinacoside or cichoric acid than the stated content, with the other two being totally devoid of either compound.\nAnother major extrinsic quality problem concerns substitution and/or adulteration. Herbal medicines collected in the wild as well as some cultivated source materials, where more than a single species is grown in a given farm or site, can lead to nontargeted species being harvested by either accidental substitution or intentional adulteration. Substitution of Periploca sepium Bunge for Eleutherococcus senticosus (eleuthero) had been well documented (Awang 1997), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had traced the original adverse reactions attributed to plan- tain (Plantago ovata Forsk.) as having actually been caused by Digitalis lanata Ehr., a contaminant introduced during harvesting of plantains (Slifman et al. 1998).\nUnintentional in-process adulteration with heavy metals, microbial and chemical agents (pesti- cides, herbicides, and heavy metals), as well as with foreign matter such as insects, animals, animal parts, and animal excreta during any of the stages of source plant material production or procure- ment can result in unsafe source materials (Fong 2002). Besides unintentional in-process adultera- tion with heavy metals, it is well established that Ayurvedic medicine and TCM sometimes employ complex mixtures of plant, animal, and minerals such as lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, and gold in certain formulations (Ernst and Thompson Coon 2001).\nPerhaps the most egregious impediment to the integration of herbal medicine into conventional medicine is the intentional adulteration of herbal medicine products with synthetic pharmaceutical drugs. Multicomponent Chinese or Ayurvedic herbal medicines have long been documented to be adulterated with synthetic anti-inflammatory drugs such as phenylbutazone, indomethacin, and/or cor- ticoid steroids in arthritis remedies (Farnsworth 1993). A Taiwanese study on the chemical adulteration of TM found that about 24% of 2609 herbal remedy samples collected by eight major hospitals were found to contain one or more synthetic therapeutic agents (Huang, Wen, and Hsiao 1997). In more recent years, the most infamous among the documented cases was PC-SPES, a purported Chinese herbal mixture sold in the United States for the promotion of prostate health, and which was used by many prostate cancer patients for its remarkable efficacy. Unfortunately, reports proved the product to have been adulterated with estrogen, warfarin, and other pharmaceuticals (Blumenthal 2002; Cordell 2002). These cited examples are only a few of the quality control (QC) or lack of quality control issues associated with herbal medicines that greatly affect their successful integration into modern EBM.\n22.3.2 QualIty assurance/QualIty control In ProcessIng anD manufacturIng/ PreParatIon of Herbal meDIcInes (gooD manufacturIng PractIces Issues)\n\nThe most important extrinsic factor affecting the quality of herbal medicines is the lack of effec- tive policies on quality assurance (QA)/QC in the processing and manufacturing of herbal products under good manufacturing practices (GMP; World Health Organization 2007b). These can vary from country to country (World Health Organization 1998). In some countries, herbal medicines are regulated as medicine and subject to mandated standards, whereas in others very few botanical products are available as prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) drugs.\n \nIntegration of Herbal Medicine into Evidence-Based Clinical Practice 457\nThe majority of herbal medicines marketed in the United States are sold as dietary supple- ments under the provisions of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994, and have only recently been mandated by law to be produced under cGMP (Food and Drug Administration 2007). Unfortunately, the QA/QC requirements are far short of those required in the production of prescription and OTC drugs. For dietary supplements, including herbal medi- cines, the requirements apply only to the manufacturers of the final product and not to the dietary ingredient suppliers, which have been the source of some of the most high-profile problems of adulterated, substituted, or contaminated ingredients associated with herbal dietary supplements. A study by (Liva 2009), which serves to illustrate this problem, described some cases of poor qual- ity controlled, unfinished herbal materials, including a hops (Humulus lupulus) extract, that did not meet the expected chemical profile but instead appeared to contain burned maltodextrin, Asian red ginseng (Panax ginseng), and wild yam (Dioscorea villosa) extracts containing quintozene, a fungi- cide that is illegal to use in herbal medicine, and in a solvent residue test, a purported ethanol\u2013water extract of milk thistle (Silybum marianum) was found to contain benzene, and a subsequent GC/ MS analysis showed 30 different acyclic and cyclic hydrocarbons, including benzene and toluene, which are known carcinogens. Until cGMP requirements are mandated and adhered to in the supply as well as in the manufacturing sides to ensure the availability of quality herbal products, herbal integration into modern medical practice will continue to pose problems.\nIn several countries, herbal medicines are totally unregulated. Consequently, product quality may differ from country to country, within the same country from product brand to product brand, and even from batch to batch within the same brand.\n22.3.3 Herbal mecHanIsms of actIon, bIoavaIlabIlIty, anD\nHerbs\u2019 cHemIcal constItuents\n\nThe underlying mechanisms of action of herbal medicine, whether single herbal or multiple herbal formulations, have generally not been elucidated due to the lack of knowledge of identifying their contained active and/or adjuvant phytochemical constituents. The same problem applies to the study of pharmacokinetics and bioavailability. In the case of single-molecular pharmaceuticals, there is no uncertainty as to which chemical compound is to be used for pharmacokinetic and bioavail- ability studies. Herbal medicines are constrained by their unknown and/or unidentifiable active chemical constituents (Fong et al. 2006). Nevertheless, some investigators have attempted to con- duct such studies. For example, the mechanism of action of a Chinese herbal medicine formula (consisting of seven herbs formulated based on the results of a series of in vitro experiments and a comprehensive literature review) was postulated from a study of its in vitro effect on rat peritoneal mast cells and macrophage cells (Lenon et al. 2009). It was found that the formula significantly inhibited the release of several inflammatory mediators, including histamine and prostaglandins, which led the researchers to conclude that it has multiple mechanisms and that potential synergistic effects of the individual herbal constituents could all have contributed to the actions of the formula. Unfortunately, the potential clinical antiallergic effects of the formula are yet to be tested through adequately powered RCTs, which brings into question the validity of such postulations.\n22.3.4 Herb\u2013Drug InteractIons\n\nReports on herb\u2013drug interactions are mainly from case reports that were inadequately documented and/or on the basis of in vitro studies (Awang and Fugh-Berman 2002). A recent review based on extensive literature search suggested that, when herbs are often administered in combination with drugs, there were only limited clinical observations on the interactions among humans (Hu et al. 2005). Nevertheless, the potential of interactions of herbal medicine with prescribed drugs or OTC drugs has been a major safety concern for clinicians as such interactions are difficult to predict and the general lack of available information on the herbs\u2019 composition and pharmacological actions (Zhou et al. 2007).",

    "prompt": "CHAPTER ELEVEN\n Stress and Back Pain\n From Chris\nThe day I sat down to edit this chapter for the last time, there was an obituary in the New York Times for John E. Sarno, MD, who \u201cwrote the book\u201d (Healing and Back Pain) on what he claimed (without support, I\u2019m afraid) were the psychological origins of back pain. As the Times put it, he was \u201crevered by some as a saint and dismissed by others as a quack.\u201d That is still roughly the state of his reputation today: Doctors tend to dismiss him but a lot of his patients think he\u2019s terrific. Jeremy takes a middle ground. He thinks that perhaps 10 percent of back pain has primarily emotional roots and the rest is physical. In addition, psychological elements can aggravate physical pain significantly. But 10 percent is worth a word here. More than a word, actually. Jeremy and I do not presume to give psychiatric advice\u2014or advice about stress, which is mostly what\u2019s involved\u2014but we include this brief chapter just to alert you to the possibility that your back pain may have its roots in stress or it may be worsened by stress or other largely psychological issues. \nI confess that a couple of years ago I would have been even more skeptical than I am today about stress and, by extension, about the connection between stress and back pain. But there has been a lot of talk lately about stress being the great scourge of American life, especially corporate life, and the importance of \u201cmindfulness\u201d; there seems to be broad agreement that both are real and important. Some corporations are spending serious time trying to help their people learn mindfulness. Like others of my generation, I used to think that talk about stress (I\u2019d never heard of mindfulness) was something made up in California by out-of-work yoga teachers, and I said the hell with it. That, it turns out, was a deeply uninformed view. Stress, I have lately learned, is very real indeed. And it probably can raise hell with your back, all by itself. Jeremy\u2019s estimate that some 10 percent of back pain is caused by stress is probably pretty good. \nStress is a fundamental part of our emotional wiring, and it runs deep. I\u2019m going to use a little technical language here to make me sound smarter than I am. A lot of the emotional stress we face is handled by our \u201cautonomic nervous system.\u201d How do you like that! Two branches of the autonomic nervous system have a lot to do with running emotions and related body changes. The first is the sympathetic branch, which basically speeds things up when life gets hairy. The other one is the parasympathetic branch, which basically slows things down, especially after a fight-or-flight event has made you crazy. \nThe parasympathetic system is for everyday use, when things are more or less okay. It handles routine stress in a routine way, and does not make you sick or crazy. The sympathetic system is supposed to be triggered only when things get seriously scary (we are talking about the sudden appearance of lions, say, or robbers with guns)\u2014extreme situations in which it makes sense to go crazy. If there really is a lion looming in the deep grass, you\u2019ve got to get out of there ASAP, so all the stress you can muster makes perfect sense. Same deal on the streets of the city when a thief with a knife appears out of the shadows and asks if you would be good enough to give him your wallet. Or your wife. Again, legitimate stress. \nYour body does an amazing thing in those fight-or-flight situations. Everything is instantly rewired to give you the best shot at either fighting back or getting away. One big change is in the blood\u2014of which there is not enough to be everywhere at once. It is shifted from peacetime distribution to a wartime footing. It is drained out of your digestive system, for example, and redirected to your extremities: legs to run for your life, or arms and shoulders and hands to grapple with the beast. And it goes to the parts of your brain and nervous system that deal with emergencies. At the same time, your heart cranks up to deliver four or five times as much blood to your body. The hair on your body \u201cstands up\u201d so it is better able to sense movement in the air (wow!). Your eyes dilate and your hearing becomes more acute. The nutrient absorption system is shut down, as are many other systems that have to do with routine maintenance. (Chronic, nonstop stress, which we\u2019ll get to in a minute, is a horror for a couple of reasons. First, you cannot be responding to those extreme conditions all the time: That would be like a muscle spasm\u2014it starts to hurt. Second, all those routine but deeply important processes get shortchanged, and you go to hell for lack of maintenance. So . . . chronic stress is super-bad.)\nWhen the threat passes (and if you survive), the parasympathetic system takes over and order is restored. The hair on your neck settles down, the regular allocation of blood returns, and so on. And it works like a charm for zebras and elands and such. For us, alas, not so good. As Robert M. Sapolsky tells us in Why Zebras Don\u2019t Get Ulcers, the zebra can be running furiously for its life one minute, and calmly cropping grass the next. Zebras are blessed with forgetfulness. Not us. We are blessed\u2014and cursed\u2014with the ability to contemplate and prepare for future emergencies and to hold on to and learn from past ones. We are not designed to let go. Eventually we do let go, but it takes us longer. So we have more stress than zebras. \nWe have another flaw in the way our fight-or-flight mechanism works. It is not just the lion or the guy with the knife that sets off our system; it\u2019s all kinds of stuff. Like competition in the workplace. Like fear of our boss. Like rejection or demotion for failure to achieve this or that. Which may not sound bad but it really is. Because we take that kind of stress just as seriously as we do the lion-in-the-grass type of stress. And the problem is that that kind of stress is being triggered almost constantly, in our aptly named \u201chigh stress\u201d workplaces and society. Which leads to chronic stress. \nIntermittent stress\u2014the kind that is triggered when the lion jumps out at you\u2014is useful. Chronic stress is a curse. Not a complete curse; it does enable \u201cadvanced\u201d cultures like ours to focus much harder and much, much longer than humans used to do on what we want to achieve. We run our mighty engines at near-redline levels all the time and, sure enough, we tear around like crazy . . . achieving great things. Which is nice. And we pat ourselves on the back for doing it. (And view the French, say, with contempt because they are not as nutty as we are.) We more than pat ourselves on the back; we give each other fat salaries and tremendous recognition. Being able to function at \u201credline\u201d or sympathetic nervous system levels almost all the time is richly rewarded in this country. Which is fine except for one thing: It is eating us alive. The dislocation of circulation from core to extremities, the hyper-use of the signaling system, all the profound changes that are set in motion when the lion looms short change other areas, including, interestingly enough, our lower backs. And that dislocation can cause random short circuits, muscle spasms, and weird torques to the back. And they hurt. Quite a lot. It is not the principal source of back pain, but, for those who suffer from it, it is deadly serious and is entitled to serious treatment.\nHow do you know if you are part of the minority for whom stress is a serious cause of back pain? Hard to say but basically it\u2019s just like what Jeremy says about back pain generally: Pay attention to the pain. Focus on the behaviors that seem to precede or go with back pain. And cut them out. If back pain is correlated with stressful situations, think about it. Maybe get yourself out of that mess. Or study one of the thousands of books about \u201cstress management\u201d and \u201cmindfulness.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of material out there on mindfulness, and it is helpful. \nStress-Induced Cardiomyopathy, Anyone?\nOkay, here\u2019s my own little stress story, the one that made me seriously open to the idea of stress as a serious thing. \nI was recently in the midst of a ton of heavy, work-related stuff, and we had just flown out to Aspen for a series of work meetings and such (there would be a little skiing but not much). We were starting two new businesses and neither was easy. Hilary and I got to the friend\u2019s house where we were staying late at night. But the real thing was that I had learned earlier that day that my beloved coauthor and friend, Harry Lodge, was going to die of cancer in the next few days. The whole business was the very definition of stress\u2014a \u201cperfect storm,\u201d you could say. \nThe morning after our late-night arrival, I was unpacking when I had a \u201cfunny feeling\u201d in my chest. Long story short, I told Hilary I felt weird, we called the local hospital, and soon I was on a gurney in a big ambulance being rushed to the emergency room. I was met by an absolutely terrific heart doc, a mild-mannered guy with a serious national reputation, even though he mostly practiced in a medium-size Colorado town. Lucky me. He said I was having a heart attack, and he was going to run a camera up my femoral artery (in my leg) to take some movies of my heart and put in stents to open the presumably clogged arteries . . . all the stuff I needed to, you know, stay alive. \nRats! I have always been proud as a peacock of my great heart and aerobic strength; now this! Good grief. \nBut it turns out it was not that bad. \n\u201cInteresting,\u201d the doc says, after I come out of the anesthesia. \u201cYou don\u2019t see this every day, but you did not have a heart attack. A heart attack is a failure of the heart, caused by a blockage of blood vessels that feed the heart. In a surprisingly short time, the part of the heart that is not getting fed\u2014or the whole organ\u2014dies. That is a heart attack and, mercifully, you did not have that. In fact, your heart and the vessels that feed it are in amazing shape: You will never have a heart attack.\u201d Oh. I took that pretty well, but I was curious, too. If I\u2019m not having a heart attack, why are we here? \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cInteresting,\u201d the doc says again. \u201cI have only seen it a few times, but you have a classic case of stress-induced cardiomyopathy . . . a temporary (and sometimes fatal) weakness of the heart itself, caused by stress.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be damned.\u201d \n\u201cYes,\u201d he says, \u201cExtremely lucky man. You have what is sometimes called \u2018the widow\u2019s broken heart,\u2019 common among recently bereaved spouses. Almost certainly brought on, in your case, by general stress and by concern for your gravely ill friend. [He had interviewed me briefly before the procedure.] Sometimes it is fatal, but not for you. And, if it\u2019s not fatal, it simply goes away.\u201d I nod, but I don\u2019t begin to get it. I press for more information.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the videotape,\u201d he says. He wheels over this big gadget and, in a second, I am looking at a movie of my own beating heart. Yowee! A very rare treat. None of the many tests for heart problems goes inside and takes movies; it\u2019s too dangerous. But this was not a test, and here we are. \u201cHere\u2019s the good news,\u201d he says, and points to what he says are the amazingly clear (unblocked) and peppy arteries all around my heart. And the strength of the muscles. Rare, he says, especially for an old chap like me. Then he drops the bomb. \n\u201cHere is where the stress hit you,\u201d he says, and points to the lower one-eighth of my thumping heart. \u201cYour other heart walls are vigorous and fine, pumping lots of blood. This area, they are not. Also, you have some fibrillation, irregular beats.\u201d He points. The difference is unmistakable. For a long time we both stare at my beating heart, see the weakness and the arrhythmia. \u201cThis will go away on its own in a while,\u201d he says. And repeats how very lucky I am. Huh.\nWhat\u2019s the point of the story? It\u2019s simple: Stress is real. You can see it in a movie of your heart. It can have a very real impact on your body. It literally weakens you and leaves you prone to all kinds of things. You can see stress happening on some occasions. And\u2014maybe\u2014there are things you can do about it. I received several serious lectures from doctors during my \u201cwidow\u2019s heart attack\u201d phase, all urging me to remember that I was in my eighties and to, for heaven\u2019s sake, cut back some on my routine. Which I did. It\u2019s an interesting compromise between staying as alive and fully committed as possible. I\u2019m still feeling my way. We\u2019ll see. \nWhat about you? All we can say is, watch yourself. By which we mean, keep an eye on your own situation and bear in mind the possibility that your back pain may be stress related. Then our advice is to quit your job, get a bowl of rice, and sit on the sidewalk. Or go live with your parents. Some damn thing, I don\u2019t know. Stress is hard. But it is not imaginary. Read up on it. Do something. \nActually, we have some better advice than that. There are a lot of well-trained people\u2014including our friend Sarah Stuart, who has done retreats and other work with me\u2014who have studied stress and who instruct businesspeople in particular in \u201cmindfulness,\u201d a technique that the great guru in the field, Jon Kabat Zinn, defines as \u201cpaying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally.\u201d Okay. But my shallow experience with it would lead me to say it is learning to do relatively short bursts when you clear your mind of all thoughts about what\u2019s coming next (or what stupid thing",

HIGHWAY \u2013 EVENING\nThe PT Cruiser whizzes by a sign that reads \u201cLas Vegas - 10.\u201d\nEXT. UNMARKED PARKING LOT \u2013 EVENING\nMusic plays as we see the bottom half of the flaming purple\nchariot pulling into a parking spot.\nThe door opens, out step legs in black pants and black\nSketcher\u2019s shape-ups. From the passenger side, legs in\nheather-grey sweatpants and flip flops.\nEXT. ENTRANCE TO HOTEL/CASINO \u2013 EVENING\nThe music continues as they approach a hotel entrance, Min\nclutching his pile of clothes. They stare up at the sign.\nThe music stops as they take in what\u2019s around them. They\u2019re\nin the middle of nowhere. No casinos, no limos, nothing.\nMIN\nVegas is smaller than I thought.\nRuby looks down at her phone.\nRUBY\nThis neighborhood had the highest\nsafety rating in all of Vegas.\nThey look around some more. Wow, really, there\u2019s... nothing.\nRuby looks back down at her phone.\n\n32.\nRUBY (CONT\u2019D)\nBut they do have slot machines, so\ntechnically, it\u2019s a casino.\nRuby\u2019s face lights up with childlike rebellion. After several\nfailed attempts of working up the courage to jump in the\nrevolving door, she opts for the manual one. Min follows.\nINT. SHITTY HOTEL LOBBY \u2013 EVENING\nThis hotel hasn\u2019t passed an inspection since Min\u2019s dad left.\nThree ancient slot machines stand across the room. An old\nlady is slumped over on one, a lit cigarette in her hand.\nRuby\u2019s excitement overshadows the glaring shittiness of this\nhotel. She walks over to the counter and rings the bell.\nThe sleeping woman on the slot machine jolts up. BABS is in a\nsweatsuit and her voice sounds like she just took a fist to\nthe voice box. She walks over to the ancient computer.\nBABS\nEnchante! The name\u2019s Babs. How can\nI help you two?\nRUBY\nYes, I checked in via your online\nportal. And if you\u2019re open to\nconstructive criticism, I wonder if\na more updated website would help\nboost potential sales.\nBABS\nWe strive to keep things \u201cbarely\nfunctioning\u201d around here. You know,\nkeep costs low.\nBabs slaps the side of the computer to shock it back to life.\nBABS (CONT\u2019D)\nYou must be Ruby?\nRuby subtly moves her hair away from her name tag.\nRUBY\nThat\u2019s correct!\nBABS\nLooks like we have a room with two\nqueen beds. Uh oh, trouble in\nparadise?\n\n33.\nRUBY\nOh no, Min and I aren\u2019t in a\nrelationship of romantic sorts.\nHe\u2019s uh\u2026he\u2019s my friend.\nShe says \u201cfriend\u201d the way someone says \u201cfianc\u00e9\u201d for the first\ntime.\nBabs helps grab Ruby\u2019s luggage, her body fighting her every\nstep of the way.\nBABS\nFollow me, kids.\nBabs stiffly walks towards the elevators. They follow.\nINT. HOTEL ROOM \u2013 EVENING\nBabs opens the door after giving it a hearty shove.\nBABS\nWelcome to your temporary oasis.\nThe room is modest, to put it nicely.\nRUBY\nI read your customer service\nreviews online and they had very\ngenerous things to say.\nBABS\nOh, you know I don\u2019t really do that\nanymore. I\u2019m a little too old to be\ncatering to those customer needs, I\ntell you what, menopause just\nreally takes it out of-\nRuby isn\u2019t on the same page.\nBABS (CONT\u2019D)\nJust an old Vegas joke for you!\nIt wasn\u2019t a joke. Ruby pretends she gets it.\nBABS (CONT\u2019D)\nYou guys have big plans for the\nnight? Looking for any nightclub or\nrestaurant recommendations?\nMin sits on the bed and bounces to test the firmness. Still\nholding his clothes, he tips over to lay down.\n\n34.\nRUBY\nWe passed a place on our drive in\nthat I\u2019ve got my eye on.\nEXT. WALGREENS \u2013 NIGHT\nThis part of old Vegas looks slightly more alive.\nINT. WALGREENS \u2013 NIGHT\nRuby is staring at a glass freezer case. Staring at the lean\ncuisine options, she picks the chicken teriyaki stir fry.\nShe sees Min down the toy aisle playing with a bop it. She\nwanders down the greeting card aisle.\nThere\u2019s a section of cards labeled \u201cFriendship.\u201d She looks\naround to make sure no one is watching, then cautiously picks\none up to examine.\nThe outside reads in girly script \u201cLuckily for me, you\u2019re\nmore than a friend\u2026\u201d She opens it up to reveal the inside:\n\u201c\u2026because you\u2019re my SISTER til the very end.\u201d Two sister\nstick figures are hugging.\nRuby looks back at Min in the toy aisle. He just missed a\nbop, and he\u2019s hanging his head in defeat. Ruby smiles and\nlooks back at the card.\nMALE VOICE\nRuby?\nRuby hides the card like a middle schooler with a titty mag.\nShe recognizes Blake, the patron from back home.\nRUBY\nBlake?\nBLAKE\nI don\u2019t believe it! Ruby Tuesday is\nin Vegas? What are you doing here?\nRUBY\nI\u2019m uh, I\u2019m just making a pit stop\non my way to Idaho. Onto bigger and\nbetter things, just like you.\nBLAKE\nI heard about the old place burning\ndown. That\u2019s a major bummer, man.\nI\u2019m sorry.\n\n35.\nMin comes up behind Ruby, on his phone.\nRUBY\nThis is Min, you might recognize\nhim from the deli.\nBLAKE\nNo kidding! I didn\u2019t realize all\nyou guys were friends outside of\nwork.\nRUBY\nCrazy, right?\nBLAKE\nHey, if you guys don\u2019t have any\nplans tonight, we\u2019re throwing a\nparty at Sigma Chi. You guys should\ntotally stop by! Girls get in free,\nguys have to pay ten bucks.\nRUBY\nThat\u2019s very kind of you, Blake. But\nnothing has changed. I\u2019m still just\nan alcohol sales associate, not a\npartier.\nBLAKE\nPotatoe, Patahtoe. Well, here, in\ncase you change your mind\u2026.\nBlake grabs a marker from a nearby shelf and takes the card\nRuby has failed at hiding. She looks mortified. He writes on\nthe back of it.\nBLAKE (CONT\u2019D)\nThose are directions on how to get\nthere. Sorry, you probably have to\nbuy that now.\nRUBY\nYeah I wasn\u2019t planning on buying\nthis silly card, but I guess I will\nnow just because you wrote on it.\nBLAKE\nAlright well I gotta go grab some\nrubbers. I\u2019ll see you there, Rubes?\nRUBY\nWe\u2019ve got a long day of driving\nahead of-\n\n36.\nBLAKE\nI\u2019ll take that as a maybe.\nBlake jogs out of the aisle. Ruby still tries hiding the card\nfrom Min, but she looks down at the back of it to see Blake\nhas written \u201cPut UNLV Sigma Chi in your GPS.\u201d\nINT. SHITTY HOTEL LOBBY \u2013 NIGHT\nRuby puts her Lean Cuisine in the communal microwave. She\nreaches into her back pocket and pulls out a tiny laminated\nphotograph of Marion Barton Skaggs, founder of Safeway. His\ntitle, birthday, and death day are labeled.\nRUBY\nWhat are you trying to tell me,\nMarion? Have I failed my duties as\nan alcohol sales associate by not\npartaking in alcohol\u2019s most\nfruitful environment? Am I\u2026am I\nmeant to party?\nBabs comes rolling behind Ruby facing backwards on an office\nchair. Ruby doesn\u2019t see her at first.\nBABS\nYou looking to party?\nRuby jumps. The microwave goes off.\nRUBY\nNo. I\u2026I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ve never\ndone it before.\nRuby shyly stirs the stir fry and puts it back.\nBABS\nWell if you\u2019re looking to have a\ngood time, I can certainly help you\nout.\nBabs winks and conspicuously contorts her face.\nRUBY\nAren\u2019t you worried about leaving\nyour station in the event that more\npatrons arrive to check in?\nBabs laughs so hard she starts to cough uncontrollably.\nBABS\n(in between coughs)\nOh honey...That\u2019s not gonna happen.\n\n37.\nRuby ponders this more than anyone should.\nBABS (CONT\u2019D)\nI used to be the hottest partygoer\nin Vegas. These legs would stop\ntraffic on the strip like you\nwouldn\u2019t believe before the\nvaricose veins set in.\nRUBY\nAnd you remember enough about it to\nteach me?\nBABS\nOh baby, it\u2019s like riding a bike.\nHow long do we have until the party\nstarts?\nRUBY\nHe said it starts at eight.\nBABS\nYou won\u2019t want to get there until\n9:30 at the earliest.\nRUBY\nI don\u2019t show up late.\nBABS\nYou do now.\nRuby looks over at Min, who has been sitting at the slot\nmachine the entire time on his phone.\nRUBY\nHey, Min?\nHe looks up.\nRUBY (CONT\u2019D)\nDo you wanna go to a party?\nMIN\nOkay.\nBABS\nFollow me.\nBabs pushes herself through the lobby on the office chair.\nMin and Ruby follow.\n\n38.\nINT. BACK ROOM \u2013 NIGHT\nMin and Ruby stand in a dark closet. Babs finishes pouring\nbooze into two red solo cups and hand them to Min and Ruby.\nBABS\nDrink this.\nRuby, without thinking, goes to drink the contents of the\ncup. The taste hits her, and she spits all over her clothes.\nShe screams/chokes.\nRUBY\nWhat is that?\nBABS\nAbout six different kinds of\nalcohol and a hearty dash of\nCholula. Call it Babbie\u2019s Pregame\nSpecial.\nRUBY\nOh\u2026\nWait, that\u2019s what alcohol tastes like?\nRUBY (CONT\u2019D)\nOH\u2026\nMin finishes his cup.\nMIN\nAaah.\nRuby and Babs look on with disbelief.\nINT. HOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - NIGHT\nAn earnest Babs is making an absolute mess of Ruby\u2019s hair.\nMin curiously watches on.\nBABS\nListen up kittens, there\u2019s a few\nthings you should know about\nparties.

    "prompt": "Part 5 (acknowledge and wait for the next part):\n\nGreater Blairstown (Ridge View Echo)\n\nThe third and final community where we conducted an information needs assessment was greater Blairstown, which includes four adjacent municipalities. As before, we asked community members how they feel about where they live, which topics they want to see covered by their local news sources, how they primarily get local news, and how those who have engaged with Ridge View Echo feel about the outlet so far. \n\nThe survey was circulated in a number of ways, including by the Ridge View Echo among its social networks; by members of the Blairstown Enhancement Committee, the organization that founded the Ridge View Echo; in popular Facebook Groups; and by printed flyers that were posted around town (primarily in Blairstown). Because of the demographics of greater Blairstown, the survey was offered only in English and the two focus groups were also conducted in English. We did not have the problem of bot-generated or false responses in greater Blairstown to the same extent that we did in the other two communities. The final number of survey responses was 170. (As before, please keep in mind that all of the survey questions were optional, so the numbers reported often do not add up to 170.)\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, most of the survey respondents live in Blairstown, followed by Frelinghuysen, Hardwick, Knowlton, and Newton. This may suggest the order in which the Ridge View Echo should prioritize resources by town \u2013 at least in the beginning \u2014 as one could argue that more coverage of a town like Knowlton could attract more readers from there.\n\nThe graph below shows how long survey respondents have lived in their town. Half of the survey respondents (49%) have lived in the area for 25+ years, showing a robust depth of connection to the community. Only 4% had moved to their town less than 1 year ago. The focus group respondents also tended to be people who have lived in the area for a decade or longer.\n\nThe publisher of Ridge View Echo requested that we do some further analysis on the survey responses, based on four independent variables of interest: age of respondent, how long they\u2019ve lived in the area, the town in which they live, and how they voted in the most recent presidential or local election (i.e. political affiliation). That more granular analysis is interspersed throughout.\n\nViews about the community and life\n\nOverall, survey respondents like living in greater Blairstown: 27% of people said that their town is an \u201cexcellent\u201d place to live, while 84% said at least \u201cgood.\u201d \n\nThe things respondents most strongly liked about the area included a low crime rate, it being a good place to raise a family, and the area\u2019s proud history and traditions. Almost half of respondents \u201cstrongly agree\u201d with those characteristics, and nearly 8 in 10 at least \u201csomewhat agree.\u201d The top concerns expressed related to the number of entertainment options, lack of jobs, frustration with local politicians, and the arts and culture scene. But even on each of those topics, more people were satisfied than dissatisfied.\n\nThe graph below shows the length of time living in the community mapped against how people rated their community. In general there is a high level of satisfaction, with very few respondents rating the place they live as less than good or excellent. Satisfaction was highest among people who have lived there between 11 and 24 years. \n\nWhen satisfaction is analyzed in terms of the age of the respondent, we see that, as above, people in general are happy with their community, with very few rating it \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cterrible.\u201d In addition, happiness with one\u2019s community increases as respondents\u2019 ages increased.\n\nWe also looked at greater Blairstown respondents\u2019 level of community satisfaction crossed with their political affiliation. Democrats felt markedly less optimistic than Republicans or those who abstain or vote split tickets. This may have to do with the fact that, according to one of the publishers of Ridge View Echo, the conservative element in the community is prominent in the public sphere, especially loud and partisan online.\n\nPassions and worries\nSome questions in the survey explored what respondents enjoy or worry about in their own lives. This information can be used by publishers to better understand the human experience of their audience, and to create content that feels more personally relevant to what is on their minds. \nFocus group participants named friends and family, cooking, nature, religion, yoga, and personal finance as topics that they felt passionate about. \n\nFocus group participants worried about crime, political division, and their children\u2019s schools. \n\nKeeping up with the news and topics of concern\n\nNearly 70 percent of survey respondents said it is \u201cvery important\u201d or \u201cextremely important\u201d to keep up with local news. Meanwhile, nearly half (45%) said it is harder today to keep up with local news compared to three years ago; 31% said it was easier. The focus group participants also felt strongly about following local news and events, and expressed frustration that certain local information was either difficult to find or had negative political overtones. \n\nWhen we look at the desire to keep up with local news by age, the survey respondents confirm what other surveys found: as people age they consider keeping up with the news more important. A large majority of the survey respondents in greater Blairstown who are over the age of 30 consider keeping up with local news to be extremely or very important \u2013 with zero over the age of 40 saying it was \u201cnot very\u201d or \u201cnot at all\u201d important. This is good news for a hyperlocal venture like Ridge View Echo, which are looking to fill the information gaps that exist there.\n\nThere are a few most-common ways that people in greater Blairstown discover local news. Each item below is reported to be used every day by 4 in 10 people, and at least weekly by 60 to 70% of people, to find local news and information:\nFrom friends/family.\nGoogle searches.\nReading Facebook News Feed.\nReading Facebook Groups.\n\nSocial media did not figure as prominently among the focus group participants, but they did mention using Google searches for local news and information. The focus group participants also discussed difficulty in finding information about basic goings-on around town, like community events and municipal meetings. Meanwhile, about 50% of survey respondents visit the Ridge View Echo site at least weekly, and 71% visit a few times a month.\n\nFocus group participants lamented the lack of a paper newspaper and wondered whether Ridge View Echo would ever consider publishing in print. This conversation led to a discussion about the visibility of the Ridge View Echo as a news source without a print editionWhile participants recognized that printing is expensive, they suggested at least a semi-regular print publication would go a long way toward raising awareness about the Ridge View Echo.\n\nTopics for news coverage\nThere was strong interest among survey participants in the \u201chard news\u201d topics of crime, local politics, and health care. Respondents are also looking for ways to connect with the small-town feel of their area through celebrations of history/traditions, local community groups, and hearing stories about people who live in their community. Finally, there was a bundle of topics related to things to do and enjoy \u2014 raising a family, environmental beauty, outdoor recreation, restaurants/bars, entertainment, and arts & culture, in which respondents expressed interest.\n\nThe focus group participants talked more about coverage of the school system, and voiced frustration about the current lack of coverage of municipal meetings, specifically those that discuss how taxpayer money is spent. They also voiced interest in a local \u201cAngie\u2019s List,\u201d that could connect them with contractors and other service providers.\n\nDesire for Ridge View Echo coverage\nBecause Ridge View Echo had published several editions at the time of our research, we wanted to ask about familiarity with the outlet, and thoughts about its performance thus far. Of 154 respondents, 56% were \u201csomewhat familiar,\u201d 32% were \u201cvery familiar,\u201d and 12% were \u201cnot at all familiar.\u201d The relatively high level of familiarity likely has to do with the fact that the survey was circulated by people close to the outlet, but also shows that they are capable of reaching people outside their immediate orbit and that there is room for growth.\n\nThe survey also asked about specific topics of interest, ranging from sports to health care to education. For each, respondents could respond on a scale ranging from extremely to not at all important (or \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d). We were then able to look at each of these topics by age, town of residence, political affiliation, etc. For example, we learned (perhaps not surprisingly) that respondents aged 18 to 29 are least interested in news about local government or politics (they were least likely of all age groups to rate it \u201cextremely important\u201d and most likely to say \u201cnot at all important\u201d), while 80% of respondents over 70 rated such news \u201cextremely important.\u201d Another example \u2013 this one more surprising \u2013 was that respondents between the ages of 60-69 were the most likely to say that news about the environment and pollution were \u201cextremely important\u201d (57%), while only 37% of respondents ages 18-29 said the same.\n\nThe amount of space required to report the full breadth of findings exceeds what is available here, but all of this information has been given to the publishers and they are now able to hone their coverage based on this analysis. In an ideal world, they would be able to conduct a similar survey on a yearly basis to understand how these preferences change as their audience grows.\n\nRole of social media\nFacebook is a major factor among the respondents in greater Blairstown. Nearly 8 in 10 people are getting local news and information there regularly. Notably, news engagement is about the same for Facebook News Feed or Facebook Groups, suggesting that Ridge View Echo should promote its stories and reach readers through both News Feed posts and Facebook Groups. \n\nIn particular, the Facebook Group \u201cGoings On in the Blairstown Area\u201d is ranked as the most satisfactory source of local news. A total of 30% of respondents said they \u201clove it and use it all the time,\u201d while 72% \u201cfind it useful and use it sometimes.\u201d Another 20% say they \u201cdon\u2019t love it, but use it when they have to.\u201d Only 18% of people dislike or haven\u2019t heard of this Facebook Group. Other Facebook Groups, including but not limited to \u201cWhat\u2019s Happening in Blairstown\u201d and \u201cBlairstown News\u201d, are used at least sometimes by about 70% of respondents.\n\nAdvertising effectiveness\nRidge View Echo is supported in part by advertising, and wanted to know what its existing audience thought of the ads it had placed so far. Fifty-nine percent of respondents said they \u201cfind the advertising on the site interesting and relevant,\u201d and 60% said they \u201cwould like to see ads from more local businesses on the site.\" Further, 58% said they \u201care more likely to shop at a business that advertises on the site,\u201d and more than a third of the respondents (36%) said that an ad on the site had led them to make a purchase or take an action over the past year. This is useful data for a startup like Ridge View Echo to take to both current and potential advertisers.\n\nHow people use local news\nWe asked people what are the most important reasons they follow local news. The top response was \u201cto stay informed and be a better citizen\u201d (57%). This suggests that Ridge View Echo\u2019s coverage of core civic activities of local government and public affairs should be prominent. The second answer was \u201cfind places to go and things to do\u201d (46%) \u2014 which points to the importance of \u201cservice journalism\u201d that is simple but extremely practical and personally helpful to the individual.\n\nComparing satisfaction with news sources\nFinally, we asked survey respondents to compare their satisfaction with several different local news sources. Respondents reported being most satisfied with the local news they get from several different Facebook Groups, followed by Ridge View Echo. Instagram is also fairly popular as a local news and information source, with 50% finding it useful and using it at least sometimes. The other news outlets we asked about \u2014 Express Times, New Jersey Herald, The Press, and Pocono Record \u2014 ranked lower in satisfaction, suggesting that these may be secondary sources for some portion of the audience, but not strong competitors.\n\nRecommendations given to Ridge View Echo\nBelow are the recommendations we gave, based on both our discussions with the publishers and the analysis above.\nCreate a dedicated section for posting the dates and times of upcoming municipal meetings, similar to your Events page; publicize it via your newsletter and social media.\nGo one step further and cover municipal meetings regularly, even if it\u2019s simply by providing a transcript.\nGet more involved on Facebook, both on the feed and in groups.\nContinue to cover feel-good lifestyle issues in addition to hard news.\nConsider adding a section that allows people to recommend service providers; maybe service providers could recommend themselves for a fee (similar to advertising but in a dedicated section)? Could list it as a Directory similar to the others that you have under Resources.\n\nBased on our recommendations, and given the available resources, the Ridge View Echo decided to make the following changes:\n\nHire an associate director to provide more service journalism and promote Ridge View Echo in the community.\nIncrease coverage of local school board communities (1 high school and 3 elementary schools).\nIncrease coverage of local events in Frelinghuysen, Hardwick and Knowlton townships.\n\nAfter the proposed changes had begun to be implemented, we sent a follow-up survey to the people who had filled out the survey or participated in one of the focus groups, asking them how often they visit Ridge View Echo\u2019s website and for their opinion about each of the proposed changes. As with the others, we included an open-ended question for any other suggestions. The response in greater Blairstown was better than in Paterson or Trenton but still low (N=14). We attribute the lackluster response rates to a lack of financial incentive and to the timing of the surveys, which were sent out during the busy holiday season.\n\nGreater Blairstown respondents reported visiting Ridge View Echo\u2019s website regularly; roughly half said they visit a few times a week and half said a few times a month (recall that they publish new content every two weeks). An overwhelming majority agreed with the changes they are making \u2013 again not surprising given that the suggestions for these changes came from the community. Additional suggestions for other topics that they\u2019d also like to see more coverage of included state and county politics, the local arts scene, local crime, and success stories of local businesses. \n\nThe respondents also gave constructive suggestions for further expansion, including a \u201cletters to the editor\u201d section, expanding to more adjacent towns, and more publicity to reach a wider audience.",
    "answer": "Part 5 (acknowledge and wait for the next part):\n\nThank you for sharing the detailed findings and recommendations for Ridge View Echo in greater Blairstown. It's interesting to see how community input has influenced the changes that Ridge View Echo decided to make in their coverage and approach. I'll wait for the next part of the report.",

    "prompt": "You are an expert advisor to digital transformation agencies to enable their success. Our agency is responding to an RFP for a university in California that we have a historical relationship with. Read their following RFP for a website redesign and implementation project, and tell me what you would recommend for a budget to complete the project and the key themes for success.\n\nThe RFP:\n\n Request for Proposal for Redlands.edu\nWebsite Design and Implementation\n University of Redlands 1200 East Colton Avenue Redlands, CA 92374-3720\n\nIntroduction\nThe University of Redlands (the \u201cUniversity\u201d or \u201cU of R\u201d) is a non-profit 501(c)(3), public benefit corporation founded in 1907, and located in Southern California 65 miles east of Los Angeles and 35 miles west of Palm Springs in the San Bernardino Valley.\nThe University is an independent liberal arts and sciences university providing instruction for students of traditional college age through its on-campus residential program, the College of Arts & Sciences, and for adult learners through its School of Business & Society, School of Education, School of Continuing Studies, and the Graduate School of Theology. The University of Redlands is a private, nonprofit University that provides a welcoming environment where access and opportunity come together to equip individuals to build a bright future for themselves. The main residential campus is in the heart of Southern California, near beaches, mountains, and deserts. In addition to three regional campuses in Rancho Cucamonga, Riverside, and San Diego, Redlands also maintains a 20-acre campus in Marin, 15 miles north of the Golden Gate Bridge. The Marin campus hosts graduate courses through the Schools of Theology, Education, and Business & Society. Redlands serves more than 3500 undergraduate and graduate students, 34 percent of whom are first generation college students. Offering more than 40 undergraduate programs, including the Johnston Center for Integrative Studies where students personalize their own interdisciplinary study, Redlands has 30 graduate programs in business, education, geographic information systems, theology, public policy, and music. The Redlands Promise guarantees students earn a degree in four years and ensures affordability. Students collaborate with engaged faculty mentors who blend liberal arts and professional programs, further connecting the classroom to real-world issues.\nThe University of Redlands is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III school offering 21 men\u2019s and women\u2019s athletic programs that contend for conference championships in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SCIAC) and vie for national opportunities in the NCAA. Also known for having of the highest study abroad participation rates among its peers, Redlands students travel the world, choosing from more than 100 international programs, including the renowned Salzburg semester, which invites students to immerse themselves in the living-learning community while actively participating in the local culture. The U.S. Department of State has designated Redlands as a top producer of Fulbright students, awarding 27 Fulbright scholarships since 2008. The School of Education offers teaching credential and graduate programs that foster reflective practice based in equity and access with degree and credential programs that train students to become well-rounded practitioners in today\u2019s diverse educational landscape. Graduate programs are designed to meet the needs of working professionals including the Master of Arts in Teaching and Learning, and Master of Arts in Clinical Mental Health Counseling. The School of Business & Society equips students with skills to successfully impact business in today\u2019s complex environment. Programs allow individuals to take their careers to the next level with a BSB, MBA, Master of Science in Business Analytics, or Master of Science in Organizational Leadership. The Presidio Center for Sustainable Solutions offers programs that focus on social and environmental sustainability in business. The University recently launched the School of Performing Arts, bringing together music,\n University of Redlands Page 2\n\ntheatre, and dance. The Conservatory of Music offers the opportunity to learn to perform, interpret, and teach music in a setting. The Master of Science in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) program is an intensive, one-year program that draws international acclaim, due to the close collaboration with City of Redlands-based Esri, the world\u2019s leader in GIS technology. Redlands places an emphasis on community impact, and its community service-learning program has received national acclaim as students annually complete over 120,000 hours of public service annually around the world. Redlands holds the Carnegie Civic Engagement classification.\nProject Goal\nAs part of the University\u2019s new strategic plan, Forward Together, the goal of the institution is to lead California in providing personalized professional education. The goal of the website project is to highlight U of R strengths and differentiators though its online presence in one of the noisiest and most competitive marketplaces for students and families considering higher education. A new website for Redlands.edu will not only meet but exceed visitor expectations by providing a personalized experience using automated content recommendations.\nThe site will serve content dynamically for each visitor to provide a personalized experience. To facilitate this, the website\u2019s Content Management System (CMS) will gather implicit and explicit data on visitors and then surface appropriate content. Visitor data and behavior patterns will be collected and processed by the CMS\u2019 Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning, and advanced customer data platforms. The website will be the data hub between the institution\u2019s Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system (such as Slate) and third-party marketing platforms. Data sharing between the platforms will allow the CMS, enrollment teams, and content managers to make data-driven decisions to improve the visitor experience.\nThis ambitious approach is new for Redlands, and possibly for higher-ed in general, but with the right partner, we feel we can make this a reality. We seek a partner that can expertly, efficiently, and expeditiously handle the front-end design of the site and the back-end implementation of the core platform code.\nOverview and Background\nCMS\nThe current website was originally launched in March of 2016 using Episerver (now Optimizely) CMS. It has gone through several major backend code updates as well as frontend design overhauls. The current on-prem CMS version is nearing end of life and Redlands will be moving to a new solution.\nCurrent CMS integrations are:\n\u2022 Azure Search\n\u2022 Azure Blob Storage\n\u2022 Azure CDN\n University of Redlands\nPage 3\n\n\u2022 Azure AD / OIDC\n\u2022 Image Resizer\n\u2022 Log4Net\n\u2022 Siteimprove\n\u2022 GETA tags\n\u2022 Custom internal Emergency Alert Service (HTTP, SignalR)\n\u2022 Other minor custom web app integrations via HTTP\nCommerce\nAn Optimizely commerce platform was launched in 2020 to facilitate transactions for the institution. Visitors use the platform to purchase a variety of hard goods, digital items, classes, and certificates.\nCurrent Commerce integrations are:\n\u2022 Custom Ellucian Colleague integrations for\no Import Course/Sections (Products) (HTTP) o Enrollment Service (HTTP)\nContent Management Structure\nRedlands has taken a decentralized approach to content editing and management. About 200 editors across the institution are responsible for creating, editing, and managing content. There is a range of technical abilities within the group. Some struggle with the current CMS editor screens. The new site will address the needs of the staff that manage the site.\nNew Site Needs\nAs pleased as we were when the current website launched, much has changed since then, and an update is needed to stay relevant. Our current challenges that will need to be addressed with the new site include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 Mobile-first design approach\n\u2022 Accessibility standards\n\u2022 Information architecture and navigation\n\u2022 Content layout and page templates\n\u2022 Personalized content experience\n\u2022 Personalized internal site content search with facets and filtering\n\u2022 Measure, report, and respond to site performance\n\u2022 Measure, report, and respond to content performance\n\u2022 Experimentation of content and design\n\u2022 Simplified experience for web editors\n\u2022 Data integration between the website, CRM, and marketing platforms\n\u2022 Stable commerce experience with customer account management features\n University of Redlands\nPage 4\n\nPreliminary Work and Determinations for the Initiative\nThe CMS/Commerce solution has already been determined.\nRedlands will move to Optimizely\u2019s Digital Experience Platform (DXP) cloud service. The DXP environment provides a suite of technology to create a best-in-class web experience for our visitors. Most of the features are new to Redlands and some are not commonly deployed in the higher-ed space.

    "answer": "Based on the RFP for Redlands.edu website redesign and implementation, I would recommend a budget of $400,000 to $500,000 to complete the project. This range takes into account the complexity of the project, including the advanced features and integrations required.\n\nKey Themes for Success:\n\n1. Mobile-first and accessible design: The new website should prioritize a mobile-first design approach, ensuring that it is responsive and accessible across various devices and platforms. Additionally, the site should meet accessibility standards to cater to all users, including those with disabilities.\n2. Personalized content experience: Implement AI and machine learning-powered visitor intelligence to deliver automated content recommendations based on user behavior and data, ensuring a personalized experience for each visitor.\n3. Seamless data integration: Efficiently integrate the website with the University's CRM system (such as Slate) and third-party marketing platforms, allowing for data-driven decisions to improve the visitor experience and content management.\n4. Simplified experience for web editors: The new website should provide an easy-to-use content management system for the University's staff, catering to a wide range of technical abilities.\n5. Optimizely DXP expertise: Special consideration should be given to agencies with experience in implementing Optimizely DXP, as well as its Data Platform (formerly Zaius Customer Data Platform) and integrating third-party data with the platform.\n6. Familiarity with higher education landscape in California: Agencies with experience in the higher education landscape in California may be better equipped to understand the University's needs and target audience.\n7.

    "answer": "Crime Prevention: Observing Protection Strategies in Two Canadian Neighborhoods\n\nIntroduction\nCrime prevention is an important aspect of maintaining safety and security in any community. In Canada, a social responsibility method of crime prevention is largely emphasized, with an emphasis on protection/avoidance strategies. In this assignment, we will observe and record two different types of protection/avoidance strategies in two different neighborhoods in Canada. One will be an example of \"surveillance\" and the other of \"access control.\"\n\nLocation 1: Downtown Vancouver\nThe first neighborhood we observed was in downtown Vancouver. We noticed that there were several surveillance cameras installed in public areas, including on buildings, street corners, and public transit. These cameras are an example of mechanical surveillance. The presence of surveillance cameras is important in preventing crime as it helps to deter potential criminals and can also provide evidence to assist law enforcement in identifying and prosecuting offenders.\n\nIn addition to mechanical surveillance, there were also several \"natural\" surveillance strategies in place in this neighborhood. For example, many of the buildings had large windows facing the street, which allowed for increased visibility of public areas. This form of natural surveillance is important as it increases the likelihood of people witnessing crimes in progress and reporting them to the authorities.\n\nOverall, we believe that the combination of mechanical and natural surveillance strategies in this neighborhood is effective in preventing crime. However, there is still room for improvement. For example, there could be more streetlights installed in darker areas to improve visibility at night.\n\nLocation 2: Suburban Ottawa\nThe second neighborhood we observed was a suburban area in Ottawa. Here, we noticed that many of the houses had high fences surrounding their properties, which are an example of access control. This form of access control is important in preventing crimes such as burglary and trespassing, as it makes it more difficult for potential offenders to gain access to the property.\n\nIn addition to physical barriers, many of the homes also had security systems installed, which are another example of access control. These systems can include features such as motion sensors, alarms, and video surveillance, which all serve to deter potential offenders and alert homeowners and authorities of any suspicious activity.\n\nWe believe that the combination of physical barriers and security systems in this neighborhood is effective in preventing crime. However, there is still room for improvement. For example, the community could implement a neighborhood watch program to encourage residents to keep an eye out for suspicious activity and report it to the authorities.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, we observed and recorded two different types of protection/avoidance strategies in two different neighborhoods in Canada. These strategies included surveillance and access control, which are important in preventing crime. In both neighborhoods, we found that the combination of mechanical and natural surveillance strategies, as well as physical barriers and security systems, were effective in preventing crime. However, there is still room for improvement, and we recommend the implementation of additional measures to further enhance safety and security in these communities.",

    "prompt": "read this research about writing a sitcom and let me know when you are done Sitcome\n\nDefining the Genre\nSo, what is a situational comedy? As the sitcom clich\u00e9 goes, Webster\u2019s dictionary defines \u2018sitcom\u2019 as:\n\u2018a radio or television comedy series that involves a continuing cast of characters in a succession of episodes\u2019\u00a0\nSo a sitcom is simply a comedy in a situation. Frequently, this incorporates an ensemble cast of characters, who rarely change and rarely develop. The Simpsons is a sitcom which best exemplifies this lack of change as even after 30 years, the central characters are still the same age, in the same house, in the same town and even in the same clothes.\nThe situation is the place to start when writing a sitcom. The location and the cast of characters is vital to fuelling the comedy.\nSo, the \u2018precinct\u2019 or primary setting. This will be the starting point for the controlling idea of the show. When it comes to precincts there are three typical types of locations in which a sitcom can be situated.\n\\* The workplace\n\\* A home\n\\* A combination of the two\n\u00a0\n1. Workplace\nBrooklyn Nine Nine uses a literal precinct in the form of the 99th Police Precinct. This is classed as a workplace situation comedy and features police officers in their various roles.\nOther examples of workplace sitcoms include the TV studio in 30 Rock, the bars in It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Cheers, the basement filled with nerds in The IT Crowd, the various political buildings and offices in Veep and The Thick of it and\u00a0the offices in The Office and\u00a0Parks and Recreation.\nThe concept of the workplace could also be less literal and include schools, universities and colleges, as in Bad Education and\u00a0Community.\u00a0The casts are therefore work colleagues or a work \u2018family\u2019.\nTo create an example, a sitcom could be set in a pizzeria, which is a place of work that would allow for a central cast of pizza chefs, owners, and waiters. But it could also feature recurring characters such as customers and delivery drivers.\n\n2. Home\nThe home precinct is demonstrated in the aforementioned eternal sitcom The Simpsons, and in a number of other shows based around where people live.\nThese types of sitcoms include Friends, New Girl, Seinfeld,\u00a0Modern Family,\u00a0What We Do In The Shadows and Spaced.\nThe primary location of each of these shows is a place where people live. Therefore, the casts consist of biological families or makeshift families formed of roommates or friends.\n\n3. Multiple Precincts\nThe precinct is not always the only location and almost all shows include a number of bases for the characters to interact in, both in private and public.\n\\* Frasier includes the radio station and Frasier\u2019s apartment as the two main bases but also frequently features a coffee shop.\n\\* Friends also centres around two neighbouring apartments and a coffee shop.\n\\* The school is the meeting place of the main characters in The Inbetweeners,\u00a0but the show itself rarely centres within the school. Each episode focuses more on the characters being put into a new situation such as a theme park trip, night out or work experience.\nIt is rare that a sitcom only centres on one place. But it is vital for your own sitcom writing experience that the characters have a location where they can all meet. There, they can link up to go on a variety of antics.\nHowever, a precinct doesn\u2019t make it a sitcom. So far, all we have is a part of the situation. Unless you have comedic characters you\u2019ve just written something more akin to a soap opera.\n\u00a0\nFunny People\nA sitcom will not succeed unless it has characters who are funny. Funny can\u2019t be the characters primary defintion though. The comedy has to come from somewhere intrinsically tied to who that character is.\nWhen writing comedic characters, Judd Apatow often starts by reading self-help books, which allow him to think psychologically about his characters and build them from flaws and insecurities. This is a good example of how even comedic characters need depth.\n\u00a0\nComedic Conflict\nA basis of contradictory personalities and conflict is integral to every sitcom and to comedy in general. It is the first thing you should be considering when creating your characters in your sitcom.\nTo continue the earlier pizzeria example, it is important to create a makeshift family that all contradict each other. This may mean ensuring that one pizza chef is an Italian pizza purist, while another is an advocate of hot dog stuffed crusts, for example.\n\n\u00a0\nDifferent Forms of Sitcoms\nAnother important consideration to take into account when writing a sitcom is what form it will take. This will determine how the script will be written. Forms of sitcom include:\nSingle-Camera\n\\* These are the simplest to write and follow dramatic writing conventions, as seen in Atlanta, New Girl, Gavin and Stacey.\n\\* Many shows use the single-camera form as an opportunity to create filmic episodes, giving the writer more scope to incorporate homages to other films and genres as seen in Community and Spaced.\n\\* The misleadingly named single-camera form usually uses more than one camera, but is shot without an audience.\nMulti-Camera\n\\* These are often studio shows, shot in front of a live audience.\n\\* A consideration when writing is to leave spaces between jokes to allow for audience laughter.\n\\* Examples include: Friends, Frasier, The Big Bang Theory, The IT Crowd.\nAnimated\n\\* Similarly to single-camera, the animated sitcom allows for more creativity. For example, the use of surrealist jokes. After all, anything that can be created can be drawn.\n\\* Examples include: The Simpsons, Rick and Morty, Family Guy, BoJack Horseman.\nComedic Genres\nThere are many different comedic genres within comedy. Sitcoms often use a combination of styles and genres within them.\nWatching and studying shows like those listed below will give you a good understanding of the potential breadth of genre within the crafting of a sitcom:\n\\* Mockumentary \u2013 eg. The Office,\u00a0Parks and Recreation, Modern Family, What We Do In The Shadows\n\\* Wit and Wordplay \u2013 eg. Frasier, Seinfeld,\u00a0How I Met Your Mother\n\\* Slapstick and Farce \u2013 eg. Fawlty Towers, Friday Night Dinner,\u00a0Arrested Development\n\\* Deadpan \u2013 eg. Flight of The Conchords\n\\* Spoof and Homage \u2013 eg.\u00a0Community, The Simpsons, Spaced\n\\* Satire \u2013 eg. The Thick of It, Veep, W1A, Avenue 5\n\\* Surreal \u2013 eg. BoJack Horseman,\u00a0Family Guy, The Mighty Boosh\n\\* Dark Comedy \u2013 eg. Black Books, It\u2019s Always Sunny In Philadelphia\n\\* Blue Comedy \u2013 eg. The Inbetweeners,\u00a0Catastrophe\n\\* Cringe \u2013 eg. The Office, Curb Your Enthusiasm\nIt\u2019s important always to link the genre of your sitcom to your core values and intensions. These different comedic genres can have different functions. When misapplied or inappropriate their strength can feel undermined.\n\\* For example, The Office is about the minutiae of office life and the ego of the central character desperately trying to impress the omnipresent documentary crew. So a mockumentary format is perfect for this idea.\n\\* Whilst Spaced is about\u00a0a group of aimless young adults saturated in popular culture. So to have it spoof and homage other films and genres makes perfect sense.\n\u00a0\nThe Sitcom Story Structure\nSitcom story structure can be viewed similarly to the scriptwriting of any television show or film,\u00a0 just condensed to a 22-30 minute script. When writing a sitcom the three-act structure can be applied as with every other genre of film or TV. This isn\u2019t a strict rule but a helpful guide to follow.\nFriends Season 1 Episode 5: The One with the East German Laundry Detergent demonstrates sitcom story structure well as it has three separate plots that all rapidly go through the three-act structure. It demonstrates how sitcoms both use the traditional film three-act structure but also have unique elements to their form as well.\n\u00a0\nFirst Act:\nThe friends are all gathered in the coffee shop. During the first act, they split up into pairs, creating three separate plots with two main characters in each.\nA Plot: Ross and Rachel agree to meet and do laundry. Ross is nervous when he convinces himself that it is a date and wants it to go well. Rachel wants to do her own laundry to feel independent.\nB Plot: Chandler wants to break up with his girlfriend, Janice. Phoebe wants to break up with her boyfriend, Tony.\nC Plot: Joey wants to take his ex-girlfriend, Angela, on a date. So, he convinces Angela to go on a double date. Angela and her new boyfriend will go on a double date with Joey and Monica. However, Joey tells Monica that Bob is actually Angela\u2019s brother, so Monica thinks she\u2019s being set up with Bob.\nSecond Act:\nAll three subplots go through mild, comedic obstacles to achieve their goals, which were established in the first act.\nA Plot: Ross and Rachel go to the laundrette. Ross defends Rachel\u2019s washing machine from being taken by a \u2018horrible woman\u2019. Ross proceeds to teach her to do laundry. Rachel\u2019s laundry doesn\u2019t go well and everything turns pink.\nB Plot: Phoebe easily breaks up with her boyfriend while Chandler is unable to break up with Janice. Chandler breaks the news to Janice and she reacts negatively.\nC Plot: Joey continues to conceal the motives behind the double date. He plants the seeds for Bob to break up with Angela by highlighting Angela\u2019s unappealing traits while he acts as a wingman for Monica. Monica and Angela go to the bathroom together and discuss Bob.\n\nThird Act:\nA Plot: Rachel stands up to the horrible woman proving her independence and Ross and Rachel briefly kiss. Ross then bumps his head on a washing machine door. During the End Tag, Rachel is icing Ross\u2019 head.\nB Plot: Phoebe intervenes in Chandler\u2019s break up and Janice leaves happily. During the End Tag, Chandler runs through the streets celebrating his newfound freedom.\nC Plot: Joey confesses to Monica that Bob and Angela aren\u2019t siblings and the two agree to break the couple up. During the End Tag, Joey and Monica return from their date, overjoyed at having \u201cripped that couple apart\u201d.\nEveryone is basically in the same position as they were in when the episode started. They have gone through minor changes but are ultimately all still sat in the coffee shop together. The story has gone in a circle.\n\u00a0\nOther Examples and Structures\nDan Harmon, creator of Community\u00a0and\u00a0Rick and Morty handily adapted the 3-act structure into a story circle. The situation is allowed to change over the course of the episode but ultimately the characters are unchanged and in relatively the same position.\nHarmon\u2019s story circle is partially based on the \u201chero\u2019s journey\u201d and blueprints a successful structure for a sitcom.\n\n1. A character is in their comfort zone or regular situation (the precinct),\n2. But they want or need something else,\n3. They go into an unfamiliar situation or cross a threshold,\n4. The character adapts to the situation while facing trials and obstacles,\n5. Finding what they wanted, whether they like it or not,\n6. But the new situation \u201ckicks their ass\u201d and forces them to pay the price,\n7. Then they return to their familiar situation (the precinct),\n8. The events of the episode have changed them. In sitcom, this is rarely drastic.\nSitcoms are only 22-30 minutes long and thus the story structure is compressed and the story is almost on fast forward.\n\u00a0\nWrite What You Know \u2013 But Make it Funny\nOne of the most common pieces of advice that people seem to tell you when writing is to write what you know. This is also true in sitcom, but as always, it doesn\u2019t mean you can only write about yourself.\nTake funny situations that happen to you and put your characters in the same situation, adapt the story of your life. If you meet someone that makes you laugh \u2013 write a similar character to them in to your medieval sitcom.\n\u00a0\nHow to Actually Write A Sitcom Script\nIn terms of how to write a screenplay, the writing process of a sitcom script is similar to any other script. However, there are a few ways in which a sitcom script may vary. Consider the following elements of a sitcom script:\n\\* The Cold Open \u2013 This is an opportunity to include a joke which doesn\u2019t play into the rest of the episode as a comedic hook to draw in a new audience.\n\\* The End Tag \u2013 Very similar to the cold open but at the end of the episode. Often it is a payoff to a small set-up from earlier in the episode. But it can also be an entirely original joke involving one or two characters (Troy and Abed often serve this purpose in Community).\n\\* Use of Flashbacks/Cutaways \u2013\u00a0Family Guy, 30 Rock and most mockumentaries frequently use flashbacks and cutaways for quick punchlines and gags.\n\\* Callbacks and Running Jokes \u2013\u00a0Arrested Development\u00a0is a particularly excellent series for having jokes that pop up in different iterations throughout the series. It\u2019s a kind of language that show itself will create and repeatedly use throughout.\n\\* Fast Paced Scenes \u2013 Scenes in sitcoms are rarely long, 1-2 pages per scene or set-up is fairly standard as it keeps the pace moving quickly and you can move on to the next joke or comedic setup quickly.\n\u00a0\nRe-Draft to Make It Funnier\nOnce you\u2019ve completed your script, workshop it with people. Read it through aloud and see which bits are funny and which bits need work. Then, re-write, re-read, re-workshop your script.\nThis process will have developed it into something that, at the very least, you and your workshop find funny. If it makes you laugh, chances are it\u2019ll make a few other people laugh.\nPerhaps more than most genres, comedy is hard to get right without finding out if it works with an audience. This is even more relevant in a sitcom. So sharing your work with others and seeing how it plays to a room (however big or small that room may be) is a vital step in the process.\n\u00a0\nAnd Finally\u2026 Don\u2019t forget to Defy Genre\nWhen writing a sitcom, remember to innovate and create a genre hybrid. Combining elements of different genres and forms can create interesting and exciting new ideas.\n\\* What We Do In The Shadows, for example, combines a house-share, a mockumentary and a world in which supernatural creatures exist.\n\\* Peep Show\u00a0takes a flat share and gives the main characters internal monologues.\n\\* Community\u00a0takes a number of different genres and uses them throughout the series to create different innovative episodes within the sitcom genre.\nInnovation makes the sitcom and your script stand out. This guide has given you the outline of what a sitcom is, how it works and how to write one.\nIt\u2019s also important to know that as with everything else, these rules can and sometimes should be broken. If you want to write a sitcom about a pizzeria then do it. If you want to stray further from the norms and set this pizzeria in a medieval kingdom, that is your prerogative.\nInnovation is important and so is enjoying what you\u2019re writing. So write what you know, and write what you like. If your enthusiasm for the idea jumps off the page, then it will be of interest to like-minded people.\nSitcoms are there to make us laugh, comfort us and re-unite us every night with characters we\u2019ve grown to know. It\u2019s vital that in a genre with these intentions, these elements are baked into to the writing.",

    "prompt": "how many words are in this audio transcript:\n\n[0:00] we talk a lot about semantic HTML but[0:03] what about semantic CSS they're coming[0:05] up with good class names in CSS is[0:07] always a bit of a struggle it's maybe[0:09] one of the more infuriating things which[0:11] is why we have so many different naming[0:12] conventions and different approaches to[0:14] authoring CSS especially when it comes[0:16] to organization and dealing with[0:18] selectors so we can attempt to give[0:20] things meaning with names but of course[0:22] the class name doesn't have any real[0:24] meaning it's easy to get them wrong and[0:26] well of course things like this would[0:28] work just as well if you were to take[0:29] inspiration from my son and use a class[0:31] like big butt[0:37] wait no no[0:49] that's probably not the best idea in the[0:51] world and people might be a little bit[0:53] confused if they're working on that code[0:54] base and come along the your big butt[0:56] class there but of course if that class[0:58] was in your HTML that selector would[1:00] work perfectly fine but if somebody were[1:02] to randomly come across it they'd really[1:04] have no idea what you were actually[1:05] wanting to do with it and that's very[1:08] different from what we have with HTML[1:10] where we have things like our nav our[1:12] header or footer or aside we have[1:13] figures we have all sorts of things that[1:16] have actual meaning to them and even[1:18] sometimes getting those right or using[1:19] them in the right way can has a little[1:21] bit of wiggle room but for the most part[1:23] it really makes our lives a lot easier[1:25] now the semantics of those elements help[1:27] convey actual meaning to the browser and[1:29] assistive Technologies as well but it[1:31] also makes it easy for developers to be[1:33] a bit more consistent and know how[1:35] things are being used so with all of[1:36] that how can we take that idea of[1:38] semantics from HTML and use them in CSS[1:41] without having to go down the route of[1:43] only selecting things like our nav or[1:45] header or footer with element selectors[1:47] so to figure that out we're going to[1:48] jump into this example that I have up[1:50] right now and this was heavily inspired[1:52] by an article that Ben Myers recently[1:54] put out so I will be linking to that in[1:55] the description I'd strongly recommend[1:57] giving it a read and I'll also have some[1:59] other good links down in the description[2:01] related to this topic that helped me put[2:03] this video together so the idea here is[2:06] this is quite a common thing that you[2:08] might see we have a current page like[2:10] this one so we have you know a regular[2:12] navigation set up with our semantic HTML[2:14] but then we have this current page here[2:16] and then of course it highlights the[2:18] page we're on so we just you know when[2:20] you go through all your different pages[2:21] you know if I'm on my about page I'm[2:23] just moving that down to there then I'm[2:24] moving that down to there and maybe[2:26] you're using some sort of dynamic system[2:28] to be able to do this with however[2:29] you're authoring you know depends on[2:31] your Tech stack and all of that but[2:32] we're highlighting the current page and[2:34] if we come back to the Styles here I've[2:36] just done this where I'm my nav link[2:38] that has a current page I've given it a[2:40] background color we're not doing[2:41] anything fancy here there's other ways[2:43] of doing this but a nice simple setup we[2:45] have a hover color for the regular one[2:47] and then we have this one one that has[2:49] the darker color and I've boosted[2:50] specificity on it to make sure that it's[2:52] working so if I hover on top of that one[2:54] we don't get the color changing nothing[2:56] too fancy but the one problem here is if[2:58] we come back to here we we've used our[3:00] nav here we've used a list here we're[3:01] using semantic elements but we're not[3:04] actually using anything semantic to link[3:06] into we're not we're not giving any[3:08] extra context to what the current page[3:10] is even though there is a way to do that[3:12] and the way to do that is an area[3:14] current equals page and by doing that[3:18] we're helping assistive Technologies get[3:20] the same hint that this is doing[3:22] visually on the page right here so right[3:25] away that's a good start but now I'm I[3:28] have this here and then I have the[3:30] current page here and that means if I go[3:33] and that you know I want to do my about[3:34] page now well that means I need to move[3:36] this thing here over down to here and[3:39] then I also need to remove this from[3:41] that link here and I do move that down[3:43] to the link here and there's a lot that[3:45] could potentially go wrong in having to[3:48] you know it's extra maintenance for[3:50] nothing it's kind of annoying on that[3:51] front and this is just some random class[3:54] that I've assigned to here this could[3:56] have been big butt like we mentioned[3:57] before and I could have it do the exact[3:59] same thing whereas this actually carries[4:01] meaning to it so if this actually[4:04] carries meaning to it and this is[4:05] actually saying this is the current page[4:07] that we're on right now well I could[4:09] hook into that with CSS so instead of[4:12] doing nav link current page like this I[4:14] could take this let's turn this into an[4:16] attribute selector by putting some[4:17] square brackets around it let's delete[4:19] what's in there and put in my area[4:21] current is equal to page[4:25] and hit save on that and now you can see[4:28] that it's still working and if we come[4:29] back to here and we delete this current[4:31] page from here and hit save[4:34] everything is still working perfectly[4:35] fine and what we've done here is[4:37] actually create a semantic CSS selector[4:39] we're using the semantics that we had in[4:41] our HTML without you know you could[4:43] select a nav a UL things like that but[4:45] we're linking into another level of[4:47] semantics and we're bringing that in[4:49] here to help style our page and that[4:52] means that things have to be done[4:53] properly from accessibility standpoint[4:55] to be able to style things so we're sort[4:57] of enforcing accessibility by doing this[5:00] as well because now if I go to my about[5:01] page it's broken because my about page[5:04] had it the old way[5:06] and I did this the old-fashioned way[5:08] with just some regular old C HTML on[5:11] every page so of course then this would[5:13] have to be removed and we do an area[5:15] current is equal to page right here and[5:18] now that's fixed and we have this[5:20] working across our pages and to be able[5:22] to do something like this requires[5:24] literally the exact same amount of work[5:27] as it would have required before the[5:29] only difference is it's a few extra[5:30] characters but the advantage is we're[5:32] bringing in[5:33] the accessibility component of it here[5:36] and we're just hooking into that with[5:38] our style sheet and how we're doing our[5:40] CSS right here to look at more examples[5:42] of types of things you can do with this[5:44] one I've looked at many times before is[5:46] using things like area expanded on[5:48] buttons for styling things like a[5:50] navigation whether it's opened or closed[5:52] so if we take a look at this when you're[5:55] doing it I have my button that's right[5:58] here we have an area expanded a false on[6:00] there and when it opens that gets[6:02] switched over to true so the JavaScript[6:04] is switching that back and forth between[6:06] the two of them but that means I can[6:08] hook in and I can style things from the[6:10] menu being open and what the menu looks[6:12] like to how my button is created and[6:15] everything using those selectors right[6:17] there another example could be down here[6:20] if you have a tabs system like this[6:22] where we can switch between different[6:24] tabs I could have everything controlled[6:27] through my area roles here that I'm[6:29] using for my tab list and things like[6:31] this that we should be setting up if[6:33] we're doing things this way so my tab[6:35] list is being set up through the role[6:37] I'm not coming up with a class and[6:38] having the role on there each tab is[6:41] being styled through that my tab panel[6:43] area selected is all coming together[6:46] here so when it's selected I'm changing[6:48] the style of it as I'm coming through on[6:50] those and if you're new to things like[6:52] this and you're not sure about them[6:53] anytime you're looking something up it's[6:55] very easy to do a nice quick search for[6:57] example let's say you need to make us an[6:59] on off switch for something you can just[7:01] do one for a11y switch and you can see I[7:04] was looking that up recently which is[7:06] why it's top of mind and you'll see lots[7:08] of different things that come up on it[7:09] and you can do some further reading on[7:11] it where a lot of the time they give you[7:13] code examples of what things are going[7:15] to look like including things like roles[7:18] that you might need to include so we[7:19] have the role of switch that are coming[7:21] on a few of these you'll see there's no[7:23] area anything but we do have the role of[7:24] switch there's other things that do come[7:26] up with these types of elements when[7:28] we're trying to make interactive[7:29] elements as accessible as possible and[7:31] that helps us hook into those with our[7:33] CSS and it helps us make our CSS[7:36] semantic as well and often the general[7:38] rule of area is don't use area if you[7:40] don't have to so just using your nav[7:42] your head or your footer things like[7:43] that are the right thing to do but as[7:45] soon as you are getting into more[7:46] complex things there are usually things[7:49] that you need to take into account and[7:51] it is really advantageous because it[7:53] makes it a lot easier to hook into[7:54] because an area selected true is nice[7:57] and you know you're not stuck thinking[7:59] do I need a tab tab opened or something[8:02] or is it opened or do I give this active[8:05] like what name do I give it you don't[8:06] have the whole worrying about how you[8:08] name things goes out the window it's[8:10] already handled for us we're good to go[8:11] and if you enjoyed this video and it[8:13] gave you a few thoughts I'd really[8:15] recommend checking out the articles that[8:16] you can see in the description that go[8:18] into a lot more detail and on a few of[8:20] the different patterns that you're[8:21] seeing here and if you're looking for[8:22] more video content I have looked at[8:24] another excessive ability issue that is[8:26] I see coming up all the time which is[8:28] the misuse of heading levels in putting[8:30] together websites and apps so if you're[8:32] curious about that that video is right[8:34] here for your viewing pleasure and with[8:35] that I would really like to thank my[8:37] enablers of awesome Jen Johnny Michael[8:39] Patrick Simon and Tim as well as all my[8:41] other patrons for their monthly support[8:42] and of course until next time don't[8:44] forget to make your corn on the internet[8:45] just a little bit more awesome",

    "answer": "It appears that this incident involves multiple alerts that were generated by different monitoring systems (New Relic and CloudWatch) regarding issues with the host \"srv01-nas\" and the applications running on it. The alerts indicate that there are problems with the Agent status, connectivity, response time degradation, and pool unavailability of Apache Web Server and the refund-api-business. The host is located in Nashville Studio on 401 Commerce St #1100 and is classified as a Windows Server. The support group responsible for this host is Windows-Support-Core.\n\nProbable root causes for these issues could be:\n\n1. Configuration problems with the Apache Web Server or the refund-api-business application.\n2. Network connectivity issues between the host and the monitoring systems.\n3. Resource constraints on the host, such as high CPU or memory usage.\n4. Issues with the Windows Server that the host is running on.\n5. Agent issue or Agent not configured properly.\n6. Incorrect monitoring configuration.\n7. High load on the server.\n8. Incorrect network configuration on the host.",

A J-1 exchange visitor subject to the foreign residence requirement who has not received a waiver of that requirement;\nand\n8. An M-1 student to an H classification, if training received as an M-1 helped him or her qualify for H classification.\nPart 1. Petition Always Required\nThe following classifications always require a petition.\nThe initial evidence listed below and the initial evidence listed under the instructions for a change of status or extension of\nstay must be included with a petition for a new or concurrent employment or for an extension where there is a change in\npreviously approved employment.\nHowever, a petition for extension based on unchanged, previously approved employment should only be filed with the\ninitial evidence required in the extension of stay instructions.\nE-2 CNMI\nAn E-2 CNMI investor is an alien who seeks to enter or remain in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana\nIslands (CNMI) in order to maintain an investment in the CNMI that was approved by the CNMI government\nprior to November 28, 2009. An E-2 CNMI investor classification is specifically limited to an alien investor who\nhas previously been granted a qualifying long term investor status under the laws of the CNMI. This classification\nallows an eligible alien to be lawfully present in the CNMI in order to maintain the investment during the\ntransition period from CNMI to Federal immigration law. An investor\u2019s nationality is not a qualifying factor in the\nissuance of an E-2 CNMI investor classification.\nThis classification expires on December 31, 2029\nA petition for the initial issuance of an E-2 CNMI investor classification must be filed within 2 years of the date the E-2\nCNMI investor classification became available, which was January 18, 2011. Petitions for the initial issuance of the E-2\nCNMI filed after January 18, 2013 will be rejected.\nRequests for extension of the E-2 CNMI investor classification may be granted, in increments of not more than 2 years,\nuntil December 31, 2029.\nApplications for the dependents of E-2 CNMI investors must be filed on Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change\nNonimmigrant Status.\nWrite E-2C in the classification block.\nThe petition must be filed with documentary evidence of:\n1. Continuous maintenance of the terms and conditions of E-2 CNMI investor nonimmigrant status;\n2. Physical presence in the CNMI at the time of filing of the extension of stay request; and\n3. The fact that the beneficiary will not leave during the pendency of the extension of stay request.\nH-1B Nonimmigrants (Three Types)\nThe H-1B classification is for aliens coming to the United States temporarily to perform services in a specialty\noccupation.\nWrite H-1B in the classification block.\nForm I-129 Instructions 11/02/22 Page 8 of 30\nA specialty occupation is one that requires the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized\nknowledge to fully perform the occupation and requires the attainment of a bachelor\u2019s or higher degree in a specific\nspecialty, or its equivalent, as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the United States.\nThe petition must be filed by a U.S. employer or a U.S. agent and must be filed with:\n1. Evidence that a labor condition application (LCA) has been certified by the U.S. Department of Labor;\n2. Evidence showing that the proposed employment qualifies as a specialty occupation;\n3. Evidence showing that the beneficiary has the required degree by submitting either:\nA. A copy of the beneficiary\u2019s U.S. bachelor\u2019s or higher degree as required by the specialty occupation;\nB. A copy of a foreign degree and evidence that it is equivalent to the U.S. degree; or\nC. Evidence of education, specialized training, and/or progressively responsible experience that is equivalent to the\nrequired U.S. degree.\n4. A copy of any required license or other official permission to practice the occupation in the state of intended\nemployment; and\n5. A copy of any written contract between the petitioner and the beneficiary or a summary of the terms of the oral\nagreement under which the beneficiary will be employed.\n6. If you are filing an H-1B cap petition for a fiscal year that H-1B registration is required, you must provide a valid\nBeneficiary Confirmation Number for the beneficiary included in this petition, along with a copy of the H-1B\nRegistration Selection Notice.\nNOTE: This evidence requirement is not applicable to H-1B2 petitions.\n7. Off-site Assignment of H-1B Beneficiaries: Petitioners seeking to place the H-1B beneficiary off-site at a location\nother than their own location must answer general questions regarding this assignment in Part 5., Basic Information\nAbout the Proposed Employment and Employer. Petitioners should advise the H-1B beneficiary of the off-site\nwork placement.\nAn H-1B cap-subject petition (including a petition eligible for the advanced degree exemption) only will be accepted for\nfiling if the underlying registration (or the petition itself, if the registration requirement is suspended) is selected toward\nthe annual numerical allocations. When applicable, registrations (or petitions) will be ranked and selected based on\nthe Occupational Employment Survey (OES) wage level that the beneficiary\u2019s proffered wage equals or exceeds for the\nrelevant Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code in their area(s) of intended employment. Therefore, in the\nH-1B and H-1B1 Data Collection and Filing Fee Exemption Supplement, Item Number 11., you must specify the\nhighest OES wage level that the beneficiary\u2019s proffered wage equals or exceeds for the relevant SOC code in the area(s)\nof intended employment. The OES wage level selected in Part. 5, Item Number 11., must reflect the corresponding OES\nwage level as of the date that the registration underlying the petition was submitted. However, if the registration process\nis suspended, the OES wage level selected in Part. 5, Item Number 11., must reflect the corresponding OES wage level\nas of the date that the petition is filed.\nThe proffered wage is the wage that you intend to pay the beneficiary as indicated on the petition. The SOC code and\narea(s) of intended employment should be indicated on the LCA filed with the petition.\nNOTE: If the beneficiary will work in multiple locations, or in multiple positions if you are filing the petition as an agent,\nyou must select the lowest corresponding OES wage level that the proffered wage will equal or exceed. If the proffered\nwage is expressed as a range, you must select the OES wage level based on the lowest wage in the range. If you are\nrelying on a prevailing wage that is not based on the OES survey, and the proffered wage is less than the corresponding\nlevel I OES wage, you must select the \u201cWage Level I and below\u201d box. You may not lower the proffered wage listed on the\npetition to an amount that would be equivalent to a lower wage level than the wage level reflected on the selected H-1B\nregistration. If the relevant SOC code does not have current OES prevailing wage information available, you should\nfollow U.S. Department of Labor guidance on prevailing wage determinations to determine which OES wage level to\nselect.\nThe H-1B classification is also for aliens coming to the United States to perform services of an exceptional nature\nrelating to a cooperative research and development project administered by the U.S. Department of Defense\n(DOD).\nForm I-129 Instructions 11/02/22 Page 9 of 30\nWrite H-1B2 in the classification requested block.\nA U.S. employer or U.S. agent may file the petition.\nThe petition must be filed with:\n1. A description of the proposed employment;\n2. Evidence that the services and project meet the above conditions;\n3. A statement listing the names of aliens who are currently or have been employed on the project within the past year,\nalong with their dates of employment;\n4. Evidence that the beneficiary holds a bachelor\u2019s or higher degree or its equivalent in the field of employment; and\n5. A verification letter from the DOD project manager. Details about the specific project are not required.\nThe H-1B classification is also for aliens of distinguished merit and ability in the field of fashion modeling.\nWrite H-1B3 in the classification block.\nThe petition must be filed by a U.S. employer or U.S. agent. The petitioner must submit evidence that establishes the\nbeneficiary will perform services at events or productions of a distinguished reputation. Such evidence includes:\n1. Documentary evidence (such as certifications, affidavits, and reviews) to establish the beneficiary is a fashion model\nof distinguished merit and ability. Any affidavits submitted by present or former employers or recognized experts\nmust set forth their expertise of the affiant and the manner in which the affiant acquired such information; and\n2. Copies of any written contracts between the petitioner and the beneficiary or, if there is no written agreement, a\nsummary of the terms of the oral agreement under which the beneficiary will be employed.\nGeneral H-1B Requirements\nThree relevant laws impacting the filing of H-1B and/or L visa petitions; include:\n1. The American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA), Public Law 105-277 (signed into\nlaw on October 21, 1998);\n2. The H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004 (signed into law on December 8, 2004); and\n3. Public Law 114-113 (signed into law on December 18, 2005).\nBecause of ACWIA, H-1B and H-1B1 free trade nonimmigrant petitioners must complete the H-1B Data Collection and\nFiling Fee Exemption Supplement, which is part of this petition. We use this supplement (formerly issued separately as\nForm I-129W) to collect additional information about the H-1B nonimmigrant workers and the H-1B petitioners, and to\ndetermine the applicability of fees mandated by ACWIA (INA section 214(c)(9)), the H-1B1 Visa Reform Act of 2004\n(INA section 214(c)(12)), and Public Law 114-113.\nA petitioner seeking initial approval of H-1B or L nonimmigrant status for a beneficiary, or seeking approval to employ an\nH-1B or L nonimmigrant currently working for another employer, must submit an additional $500 Fraud Prevention and\nDetection fee. This fee does not apply to H-1B1 petitions. The Form I-129 will serve as the vehicle for collection of the\n$500 fee.\nThose petitioners required to submit the $500 Fraud Prevention and Detection fee are also required to submit either an\nadditional $4,000 (H-1B) or $4,500 (L-1) fee mandated by Public Law 114-113, if:\n1. The petitioner employs 50 or more individuals in the United States;\n2. More than 50 percent of those employees are in H-1B or L-1A or L-1B nonimmigrant status; and\n3. The petition is filed on or after December 18, 2015.\nThe Fraud Prevention and Detection Fee and Public Law 114-113 Fee, when applicable, may not be waived. Each\nfee should be submitted by separate check or money order.\nTo determine if they are subject to any of these fees, petitioners must complete the H-1B and H1B1 Data Collection and\nFiling Fee Exemption Supplement discussed below.\nForm I-129 Instructions 11/02/22 Page 10 of 30\nH-1B and H-1B1 Data Collection and Filing Fee Exemption Supplement\nA U.S. employer or U.S. agent who seek to place a beneficiary in H-1B classification (including H-1B1 classification for\nfree trade aliens from Chile and Singapore) must file this supplement.\nThe supplement is used to:\n1. Collect additional information about the H-1B employer and beneficiary; and\n2. Determine the appropriate American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA) fee. The ACWIA\nFee is a training fee meant to fund the training of U.S. workers. But if the employer has 25 or fewer full-time\nemployees, they must pay only one-half of the required fee at INA 214(c)(9)(B). This supplement also helps to\ndetermine whether the beneficiary is subject to the H-1B numerical limitation (also known as the H-1B Cap). Please\nnote that the ACWIA fee may not be assessed to the beneficiary.\nWho is required to submit this supplement?\nA U.S. employer or U.S. agent seeking to classify a beneficiary as an H-1B or H-1B1 Free Trade Nonimmigrant worker\nmust file this supplement with the Form I-129 and the appropriate fee. (See What is the Filing Fee, for more information\nabout the appropriate fee.)\nCompleting Section 1. of the H-1B and H-1B1 Data Collection and Filing Fee Exemption Supplement Form\nAll petitioners who seek to classify a beneficiary as an H-1B or H-1B1 free trade nonimmigrant worker must answer every\nquestion in Item Number 1. of Section 1., General Information. Guidance on how to answer these questions follows.\n1. H-1B dependent employer. An \u201cH-1B dependent employer\u201d is an employer that:\nA. Has 25 or fewer full-time-equivalent employees who are employed in the United States and employs more than\nseven H-1B nonimmigrants;\nB. Has at least 26 but not more than 50 full-time-equivalent employees who are employed in the United States and\nemploys more than 12 H-1B nonimmigrants; or\nC. Has at least 51 full-time equivalent employees who are employed in the United States and employs H-1B\nnonimmigrants in a number that is equal to at least 15 percent of the number of such full-time-equivalent\nemployees.\n2. Willful violators. A willful violator is an employer whom the U.S. Secretary of Labor has found, after notice and\nopportunity for a hearing, to have willfully failed to meet a condition of the labor condition application described in\nsection 212(n) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n3. Exempt H-1B nonimmigrant. An \u201cexempt H-1B nonimmigrant\u201d is an H-1B nonimmigrant who:\nA. Receives wages (including cash bonuses and similar compensation) at an annual rate equal to at least $60,000; or\nB. Has attained a master\u2019s degree or higher (or its equivalent) in a specialty related to the intended employment.\n4. Highest level of formal education. In Item Number 2. of Section 1., place an \u201cX\u201d in the appropriate box that most\nclosely reflects the highest level of formal education the beneficiary has attained.\n5. Major/primary field of study. Use the beneficiary\u2019s degree transcripts to determine the primary field of study. DO\nNOT consider work experience to determine the beneficiary\u2019s major field of study.\n6. Master\u2019s or higher degree from a U.S. institution of higher education. Indicate whether or not the beneficiary has\nearned a master\u2019s or higher degree from a U.S. institution of higher education, as defined in 20 U.S.C. section 1001(a).\n7. Rate of pay per year. The \u201crate of pay\u2019\u2019 is the salary or wages paid to the beneficiary. Salary or wages must be\nexpressed in an annual full-time amount and do not include non-cash compensation or benefits. For example, an\nH-1B worker is to be paid $6,500 per month for a 4-month period and also provided separately a health benefits\npackage and transportation during the 4-month period. The yearly rate of pay if he or she were working for a full year\nwould be 12 times the monthly rate, or $78,000. This amount does not include health benefits or transportation costs.\nThe figure $78,000 should be entered on this form as the rate of pay.",
    "answer": "I'm sorry, I am not able to give you a completed I-129 form with the information you provided as it is beyond my capabilities. The I-129 form is a legal document that can only be filed by the employer or their representative and requires specific information, certifications, and evidence. Additionally, there are different sections of the form that need to be filled out depending on the classification of the nonimmigrant worker (in this case, H-1B) and the specific details of the job and employer. It is highly recommended that you consult with an immigration attorney or accredited representative to assist you with properly filling out and submitting the form.",

exatamente A\n\ngrande quest\u00e3o \u00e9 a seguinte\n\nquem conhece os fatos quem conhece o\n\ninqu\u00e9rito e a investiga\u00e7\u00e3o deve analisar\n\nse o presidente Jair bolsonaro viajou de\n\nf\u00e9rias ou\n\ntemeroso de alguma medida judicial se\n\nfor na Segunda hip\u00f3tese \u00e9 caso de pris\u00e3o\n\npreventiva porque a\u00ed conseguiu \u00e9\n\nconfigurada a fuga se ele apenas viajou\n\nporque n\u00e3o queria passar a faixa para o\n\nLula ele apenas viajou e creio que Cedo\n\nou Tarde voltar\u00e1 At\u00e9 mesmo porque tem\n\nagora Acho que alguma liga\u00e7\u00e3o com o PL o\n\npele j\u00e1 arranjou moradia inclusive\n\nparece que advogados para ele Isso \u00e9 do\n\njogo partid\u00e1rio aqui n\u00e3o \u00e9 Nenhuma\n\ncr\u00edtica do fundo um sal\u00e1rio \u00e9 mas a\u00ed \u00e9\n\num outro aspecto agora o grande ponto \u00e9\n\nesse Jair bolsonaro agora Ele \u00e9 uma\n\npessoa investigada \u00e9 um cidad\u00e3o sobre\n\nele todas as garantias e direitos\n\nindividuais devem incidir\n\nH\u00e9lio Beltr\u00e3o a gente viu o discurso do\n\nLula Pego aqui at\u00e9 a pergunta que t\u00e1 na\n\nnossa Tarja na TV a\u00e7\u00e3o contraria fala de\n\nlula que refutou revanchismo a gente viu\n\no Lula v\u00e1rias vezes\n\nrefutar \u00e9 oralmente evidentemente na sua\n\nno seu discurso na sua ret\u00f3rica essa\n\nhip\u00f3tese de ter uma conduta revanche ao\n\nmesmo tempo ele falou que quem cometeu\n\nqualquer tipo de ilegalidade\n\nprincipalmente ali quando tava falando\n\nsobre a pandemia ter\u00e1 de responder n\u00e3o\n\npoder\u00e1 ficar impune etc \u00e9 e o pessoal \u00e9\n\num partido sat\u00e9lite ali do PT muitas\n\nvezes criticado como linha auxiliar\n\nent\u00e3o no dia seguinte aparentemente\n\ndesse discurso de posse voc\u00ea tem um\n\npartido muito pr\u00f3ximo do PT que entra j\u00e1\n\ncom uma a\u00e7\u00e3o com o pedido de pris\u00e3o\n\ncontra o bolsonaro pris\u00e3o preventiva\n\ncomo \u00e9 que voc\u00ea avalia\n\nn\u00e3o d\u00e1 para a gente dizer nada sobre um\n\neventual a liga\u00e7\u00e3o do Lula com o pedido\n\ndo pessoal Ent\u00e3o n\u00e3o vamos entrar nisso\n\nporque meramente especulativo mas eu\n\nacho que a pr\u00f3pria atitude do Lula ontem\n\nem seus discursos eu acho que \u00e9 bastante\n\nrevanchista viu Felipe inclusive teve\n\naquele Twitch que ele apagou N\u00e3o foi\n\nisso que ele disse assim olha quem\n\nperdeu que fique caladinho n\u00e9 ent\u00e3o\n\nassim ele t\u00e1 falando com os brasileiros\n\ntodos n\u00e9 uns 49% a\u00ed das urnas que que\n\nperderam que \u00e9 para ficar caladinho quer\n\ndizer nada disso \u00e9 uma atitude positiva\n\na gente tem que lembrar que esse tipo de\n\natitude revanchista t\u00e1 traz\n\nconsequ\u00eancias vai ter mais voc\u00ea t\u00e1\n\nnutrindo mais polariza\u00e7\u00e3o ao inv\u00e9s de\n\nvoc\u00ea tentar fazer uma coisa mais\n\ntranquila n\u00e9 de olha esquece perdeu a\n\nelei\u00e7\u00e3o agora mas n\u00e3o fica pisando na\n\ncabe\u00e7a cabe\u00e7a dos caras porque isso vai\n\ngerar uma animosidade que um pouquinho\n\nmais para frente vai voltar contra ele\n\nquer dizer ent\u00e3o eu n\u00e3o acho muito\n\ninteligente essa estrat\u00e9gia ou n\u00e3o\n\nJoel como \u00e9 que voc\u00ea avalia e uma coisa\n\nFelipe a gente no Brasil aprendeu a se\n\nacostumar e at\u00e9 ficar um pouco viciados\n\nnessa coisa da pris\u00e3o preventiva n\u00e9 a\n\npris\u00e3o da pessoa que n\u00e3o foi nem julgada\n\nmas t\u00e1 ali a pol\u00edcia federal entrou na\n\ncasa levou o sujeito para pris\u00e3o para\n\ndelegacia todo mundo comemora a\u00ed sua\n\njusti\u00e7a sendo feita pris\u00e3o preventiva\n\nn\u00e3o \u00e9 justi\u00e7a sendo feita e na verdade\n\nna medida em que as pessoas se enganam\n\nsobre isso a gente acaba tendo at\u00e9 um\n\nrefor\u00e7o da impunidade no Brasil porque a\n\ngente acha fica na cabe\u00e7a ah o cara j\u00e1\n\nfoi preso n\u00e9 j\u00e1 foi preso mas na verdade\n\nn\u00e3o ele t\u00e1 preso preventivamente o\n\nprocesso dele t\u00e1 correndo ningu\u00e9m\n\nacompanha direito d\u00e1 aqui um milh\u00e3o de\n\nt\u00e9cnicas que existem no direito\n\nbrasileiro Doutor aqui vai me corrigindo\n\nmas muitas pessoas conseguem se n\u00e3o\n\naceitar sai e todas aquela sua\n\nfelicidade da pris\u00e3o preventiva que\n\naconteceu l\u00e1 atr\u00e1s deu o qu\u00ea terminada\n\nporque pris\u00e3o preventiva ela n\u00e3o \u00e9\n\njusti\u00e7a e ela acaba servindo para\n\nfacilitar at\u00e9 a impunidade em muitos\n\ncasos esse pedido do pessoal gente que\n\nque \u00e9 isso por acaso O bolsonaro t\u00e1 um\n\nforagido da Justi\u00e7a no momento que eu\n\nsaiba n\u00e3o eu quero ver o bolsonaro\n\njulgado Sinceramente eu quero eu acho\n\nque o bolsonaro teve condutas criminosas\n\nde crime de responsabilidade n\u00e3o tem o\n\nmenor d\u00favida ele deveria ter sido tirado\n\ndo Poder n\u00e3o foi infelizmente\n\ncondutas criminosas no sentido mais duro\n\nda Lei mesmo quem sabe acho que no\n\nm\u00ednimo \u00e9 preciso sim que ele seja\n\ndevidamente julgado Mas voc\u00ea come\u00e7ar um\n\ngoverno com o partido aliado pedindo a\n\npris\u00e3o do ex-presidente que perdeu a\n\nelei\u00e7\u00e3o mas n\u00e3o existe nada que possa\n\nser mais revanista do que isso as vezes\n\nquisessem prender quem votou no\n\nbolsonaro tamb\u00e9m a ira ao longo dessa\n\nsemana ent\u00e3o \u00e9 uma medida que\n\npoliticamente da mensagem completamente\n\nerrada que t\u00e1 querendo punir o\n\nadvers\u00e1rio pol\u00edtico\n\nfora do sistema de justi\u00e7a que \u00e9 pris\u00e3o\n\npreventiva n\u00e3o \u00e9 puni\u00e7\u00e3o ela deveria\n\nservir Apenas para quem est\u00e1\n\natrapalhando a investiga\u00e7\u00e3o para quem t\u00e1\n\ncom risco de fuga risco real de fuga e\n\nn\u00e3o ser feita a\u00ed n\u00e3o \u00e9 culpa do pessoal\n\nt\u00e1 gente \u00e9 pris\u00e3o preventiva virou quase\n\nque uma parte normal a\u00ed da vida\n\nbrasileira que s\u00e3o mas s\u00f3 para deixar\n\nclaro que voc\u00ea citou algumas hip\u00f3teses\n\ntem tamb\u00e9m

    "answer": "O texto apresenta uma cr\u00edtica \u00e0 forma como a m\u00eddia brasileira tem dado voz ao PSOL em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao pedido de pris\u00e3o preventiva do ex-presidente Jair Bolsonaro. O autor da cr\u00edtica considera que a iniciativa do PSOL tem um car\u00e1ter mais de propaganda pol\u00edtica do que de praticidade, e que a imprensa n\u00e3o deveria dar tanta \u00eanfase a esse tipo de iniciativa. Al\u00e9m disso, o autor considera que o presidente Bolsonaro deve ser submetido ao crivo da justi\u00e7a se houver problemas, mas que a apreens\u00e3o de passaporte \u00e9 fogo de artif\u00edcio e que \u00e9 preciso tomar muito cuidado antes de tomar medidas desse tipo. Por fim, o autor destaca que se houver irregularidades, o presidente deve ser julgado e processado, sem nenhum contexto pol\u00edtico. A cr\u00edtica apresentada se baseia na ideia de que a imprensa brasileira muitas vezes d\u00e1 mais import\u00e2ncia a iniciativas pol\u00edticas do que a fatos concretos que precisam ser apurados e investigados de forma imparcial.",

    "prompt": "let's get\ninto the tips all right so first things\nfirst\nis taking risks and listening to your\ngut\nand by risks i really do mean calculated\nrisks i don't think that it's smart to\njust\nbe impulsive as an entrepreneur\nespecially as you're transitioning into\nentrepreneurship\nit's very important to actually assess\nthe entire scope of the situation\nbefore making a risky decision so if the\nrisk\nmakes sense then jump into it it's still\na risk\num but if it is not very rational\num i really encourage you before you\ntake it\nto look at the entire situation\nand really write down like why this risk\nmakes sense\nand why this risk doesn't make sense and\nthen write down\nall the possible outcomes of taking that\nrisk\nand that's really going to help you make\nmore of a calculated risk\ncreate more of a strategy into the risk\nso that way\nwhen you take it you really take it i\nfind that when people take impulsive\nrisks\nthey still have a lot of fear bottled up\nthey still have a lot of\nanxiety inside and so when they do take\nthe risk\nit doesn't always play out the way that\nyou expected it to because you're\ncarrying\nall of this weight into the risk so when\nyou do take the leap\nuh whether that be into entrepreneurship\nor if you're rebranding or\ndeciding on someone to hire or whatever\nit is like really\nassess the entire situation\nand figure out what's the worst possible\noutcome and the best possible outcome\nand evaluate if you are willing for both\nof those things\nto pan out the second thing is to\nconnect with people\nand prioritize relationship building and\nthis is something that i'm\nreally going to work on this year i find\nthat when you are a solo entrepreneur\nyou can kind of get into the trenches\nand you're\nyou're working on your business and\neverything you're doing\nis for the growth of your business but\nsometimes we can we can underestimate\nthe power\nof you know blocking off uh\nan hour or so every other week to reach\nout to people and to see how we can\nsupport them in their businesses and to\nsee\nhow maybe we can collaborate and that is\nsomething that i have not done enough of\nand that's something that i'm bringing\ninto 2021 as a goal of mine to\nreally work on collaboration the third\nthing is to take time to take care of\nyourself\nit can get really hard as an\nentrepreneur like\njust the journey of entrepreneurship is\nnot easy\nit can be very mentally taxing just\nconstantly trying to figure out\nsolutions and put out fires and\nfigure out what to do next with your\nbusiness how to grow and expand\nyou know how to hire how to delegate and\nyou know it's not that it's like\njust this extremely hard and a negative\nsense but it can be mentally taxing and\nso\ntaking that time to just\nbreathe and give yourself the\nopportunity\nto not be the boss at all times and just\nbe you and whatever it is that\nyou have to do to pour back into\nyourself\nthat is something that needs to be\nregularly done and again\nyou guys i'm preaching to the choir\nbecause these are all\nthings that i am working to do for this\nyear\nlast year was a pretty big year for\naaron on demand\nand i didn't really get a whole lot of\ntime\non top of everything that's going on in\nthe world i didn't really get a lot of\nquality personal time and so this year\ni'm really working on figuring out what\ndoes that even mean to me like what do i\nactually need to stay fueled up\nis that working out or is that spending\ntime with my family\nor is that reading or journaling\nor what does that look like for me and i\nthink\nonce you can kind of come to that and\nhave that sense of\nself in terms of what gets you back\ncalibrated practicing that very\nfrequently and so\nthis year i challenge you to take that\ntime for yourself\num i'm not saying like scrolling on\ninstagram or watching your favorite show\nbut like really looking at who you are\nand what it takes for you to get um\nto get that push to to keep going\nthe fourth thing is prioritizing tasks\ni think prioritization is one of the\nthings that makes people who are\nbosses really good bosses because\nthey can really assess like what is\nimportant\nright now like you may have five things\nto do today\nbut what is the most important thing\nthat you need to get done today\ni that's why i love the top three method\nwhich you guys have seen me\ndo over the past couple of years i just\nlaunched the top three notebook not too\nlong ago\nand i just the idea of prioritizing\nthe three things that you need to get\ndone the most for the day\ntakes the pressure off of having so\nmuch to do in one short day\nand it just takes the pressure off of\nfeeling like you didn't get a lot done\nif you didn't get all 12 things on your\nto-do list done\nso i find that prioritization is more\nimportant than\nhaving a whole bunch of stuff to do and\nfeeling\nlike you know you checked all of these\nthings off but like\ndid you really get the thing that was\nthe top priority that should have been\ndone\ndone and i have been doing this for\nyears and it has\nreally helped my business scale it has\nhelped my channel grow\nand just knowing and practicing\nprioritizing\nhas helped me to really be able to even\ndelegate more and figure out\nwhat can i pass off to people what is\nimportant for me\nto actually be doing and that leads me\nto my next point which is delegating\nso this year y'all we are not doing it\nall\nall right we are just we are not doing\nthat\nand to delegate you do not have to be\nmaking\nfour five six figures a month you just\nneed to first be able to identify\nwhat needs to be delegated okay\num and once you can figure that out\nstart crafting some roles around the\nthings that\nneed to be delegated so if you are\nsomeone who\nis really like you have this business\nand you know you need to be\ncreating more social media content maybe\nyou find\na social media assistant who specializes\nin photography\nand so they can go out and take pictures\nwith you but they can\nalso double and do some of the posting\nfor you\nbut when you know what you need to be\ndelegating then you can start to create\nroles around those tasks essentially\nso i would highly recommend even if you\naren't\nseeing a whole lot of cash flow in your\nbusiness um\nyou can delegate by hiring\na va or an intern or someone who can\ntake some of the load off of you\njust so you can also start figuring out\nthe proper ways to delegate\nhow to train your team how to really\nwork with someone and trust\nsomeone with your work um because there\nis that\nlevel of trust that you have to start\nbuilding which can be tough when you're\nso used to doing everything on your own\nso delegating is one of the things y'all\nwe are not\ndoing it all okay doing it all is not\nsexy anymore\nso we need to start passing some of\nthose things off and trusting\nthe people that we hire to do it there\nare also a lot of resources that you can\nuse to help you in delegating\nlike fiverr like upwork\nthere are tons of different resources\nand\nalso just facebook groups there are i\nhave a facebook group the e-brand club\nthat a lot of my members barter services\ninside of so that's also a way to\nbe able to delegate without paying a\nwhole lot of money\nall right the next thing to do\nto boss up this year is to start\nincorporating more\nvideo content into your business\nnow y'all we are in doggone\n2021 i really need you to start doing\nsome video boo\nthis is the year that you really need to\nhit hard\nwith video i say this every single year\nbecause every year you could have\nstarted\nand if you didn't you need to start now\nvideo is the most powerful way to\nget people engaged with your brand with\nyour message\nand to convert them into paying\ncustomers or clients it is the fastest\nway\nto build no like trust factor and get\nthem into your\nbusinesses ecosystem so start\ncreating video content you can do\nsomething small\nas small as instagram stories or\ninstagram reels\nto quick little tips on facebook or\non instagram feed um anything\nwhere you can really get engaged and\nshare valuable content through video\nwith your audience\nis essential this year for your business\nand for your social media strategy\nnext thing you need to do to boss up is\nimplement focused\nwork you know this is tough but i am\ngetting better at doing more focused\nwork\neven if it's for one hour and a day\nwhere i'm just locked into my work\ni just find that a lot of time we do not\nfocus strong enough we have so many\ndistractions\nfrom our phones to computers to now our\nfamilies being in the house\nwith us all at the same time but if\nthere is a way that you can\nbury yourself whether it's for 30\nminutes\nor three hours where you have no\ndistractions and you can actually get\ninto a\nflow a lot of us never experience what\nit is like to\ngo through real flow like mental flow\nwhere you are locked into a task\nand your brain is just flowing on\nideas and it is flowing with\nlike productivity to get the task done\nand if you never allow yourself to get\ninto\na an isolated or secluded state\nwhere you are able to be focused without\nany distractions it's very hard to get a\nlot done\nin a short amount of time so one way i\ndid a video i popped the thumbnail here\nwhere\ni talked about working four hours a day\nfor\none week i did this trial where i could\nonly work for four hours a day\nand when i limited myself to an amount\nof time that i had of working hours\ni really got into my workflow like a lot\nfaster than i typically do\nwithout having that mental cue\nthat i'm like only able to work four\nhours a day so if you can start to\ntrain your body to not be working all\nthese\nlong hours y'all we are not trying to be\nentrepreneurs to work forever\nlike throughout the whole day and\nthroughout the whole night and not get\nsleep and not\nyou know enjoy time with our families\nand friends so i\nchallenge you to learn how to implement\nfocused work into your work days\nand start small like don't try to work\nwithout any distractions for four hours\nstraight just don't because it will be a\nchallenge\nbut try to work for 30 minutes without\ndistractions you can set a timer on your\nphone\nand just say for 30 minutes i am not\ngoing to pick my phone up i'm not going\nto answer any calls\nor any emails or do anything that are\nfrivolous tasks that make me feel\nproductive but are actually not\npushing me toward the goal if you can do\nthat for\n30 minutes and build on that every day\nby 10 or 15 minutes\nuntil you can really start experiencing\nflow for a long time\nthen that is what you need to do okay\num so this year to boss up\nwe are channeling a deeper level of\nconcentration\nand workflow the next thing is to\naddress\nfears and to really be\nvulnerable with yourself on the fears\nthat you have and why you have those\nfears\nand i've talked about this in other\nvideos but it's\njust so important to acknowledge\nwhat could potentially be holding you\nback\nwhether that be you are nervous to have\nsomeone's life depending on you and\nthat's why\nyou aren't hiring anyone that was my\nfear for\nquite a while and it's still kind of a\nfear because i don't have any\nfull-time employees yet and so um\naddressing those things and figuring out\nlike okay why\nand then figuring out how can i combat\nthis fear like what action steps can i\ntake\nto increase my revenue consistently\nso that i don't have this fear anymore\num\nso those are things that\nwe have to really start addressing if\nyou are scared\nto quit your job or if you're scared to\nlaunch your new product\nor your new service really think about\nwhy you are scared and what that fear is\nrooted in\nso that way once you address it it\nalmost\nreleases it from you and then start\nthinking about\nthe action steps that you can take to\nmove past that fear okay so this leads\nperfectly into the next thing that we\nare doing to boss up this year\nwhich is to have more faith i think that\nfaith is\nsuch a big part of entrepreneurship and\njust being a boss over your life that\nnot enough people share and\nto just believe whether you believe in\ngod or\nwhatever your belief is like honestly\ntruly believing that you can do it\nand having that faith to carry you\nthrough those hard\ntimes that in itself also can help\nalleviate\nus from so many fears and just help us\nto\nbe content with who we are where we are\nand what our plans are to move forward\nthe next tip\nis being a part of a community that is\ngoing to be supportive of you\nas you are leveling up bossing up\nstarting your business expanding your\nbusiness growing your social media\nwhatever\nit is that you are trying to do to boss\nup and level up get around people who\nare like-minded because the last thing\nyou need\nis to be around some folks who do not\nbelieve in you and who are not there to\nspeak\nlife into you to help nurture your goals\nto help push you toward your vision to\nhelp support you\nto help call out your your flaws or your\nweaknesses to help you be better\nlike you need honest good solid people\naround you and\nthat can be hard to come by i started my\nebran club\nabout a year and a half ago for that\nvery reason because so many\nentrepreneurs\nand content creators were reaching out\nsaying like i\nneed support like my family is not\nsupportive of this my friends don't\nunderstand\nand i need somewhere to go and so\nthe e brand club is a safe space for\nentrepreneurs to express\nconcerns to ask questions\nand we do weekly live lessons on\nbuilding your brand\nbuilding your business we bring some\nawesome masterclass speakers in\nwho just share a wealth of information\nso if you\nare an entrepreneur a side hustler or a\ncontent creator who is looking for\na community of support but also a lot of\nresources and a lot of knowledge\nfrom our q a to our lessons to our\nsocial media audits\nwe really pack the club with a lot of\ngreat information\nbut really the best part is the\ncommunity so if that is something that\nyou are interested in the e-brand club\ninformation will be\nlinked down below we do have\ntemporary enrollment periods so it will\nnot always be open for enrollment but\ni on the website there will either be a\nwaitlist or if enrollment is open\nyou can go on there and enroll and join\nthe club so\nthat is for anyone who really wants to\nbe a part of a group of supportive\nentrepreneurs who are all leveling up\nand are ready to take charge of\ntheir lives and just you know boss up\nokay\nso those are how we are bossing up in\n2021\nthese are things i'm doing and i really\nhope that you join along with me to do\nthe same\ny'all it is going to be a heck of\na year i'm so excited i'm so excited and\nif you enjoyed this video\nplease turn on your notifications i\nalways upload on this channel about\nentrepreneurship\ni do a lot of day in the life of an\nentrepreneur\nvideos and also

    "answer": "It seems like there are a few different topics being discussed in this conversation.\n\nThe first few messages are expressing gratitude towards someone. Then, there is a message about login queries that should be directed to Savitha mam. Following that, there are a couple of messages with images and videos, presumably related to some project work or event.\n\nAfter that, Suvetha mentions that she is having trouble working with a simulator and attaching a tricolor LED to a bridge. She attaches pictures and a video for reference and asks for help in sorting it out.\n\nThen, Harshita asks for help with a smart light that is not working, even though everything is connected and the device is online. Someone suggests starting from the bridge PC and dragging till the tricolor PC. Asha suggests connecting the IoT PC to the tricolor PC and executing the code to check if it works.\n\nFinally, someone mentions that their AWS bridge is offline and Asha requests for a connection pic to troubleshoot the issue.",

    "prompt": "2 RELATED WORK\nOn the prevalence of spoofed-source DoS attacks. In 2000 and\n2001, spoofed-source attacks were prevalent enough for researchers\nto propose methods to trace back the source of spoofed packets [47, 49]; none have seen deployment due to operational and\ncoordination costs. Recently, Jonker et al. analyzed data sets that\ncovered a two-year period (March 2015 to February 2017) to infer\n20 million denial of service attacks targeting 2.2 million /24 IPv4\nblocks, more than one-third of those estimated to be active on the\nInternet [24]. A 2017 survey of 84 operators [30] confrmed the\nlack of resources (both knowledge and time) required to accurately\nmaintain SAV fltering. The more fundamental issue is misaligned\nincentives: namely, SAV benefts other people\u2019s networks (and their\ncustomers), not the network that has to deploy it (or its customers).\nOn promotion of SAV deployment. Many academic research\neforts have described techniques to promote deployment of SAV [15,\n31, 32, 62]. In 2014, the Internet Society began to foster grassroots\ncommunity support to launch the global MANRS initiative \u2013 Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security [22], which included a\npublic commitment to deploy source address validation, among\nother routing security best practices. In \u00a78 we show that, in our\ndata, their members are no more likely than the general population\nto deploy SAV. In 2016, the U.S. National Institute for Standards and\nTechnology (NIST) provided a technical evaluation of the performance impact of deploying various types of reverse path fltering\nin commercial routers [38], and in 2018 provided deployment guidance [50].\nOn crowd-sourced measurement of SAV deployment. In\n2005, Beverly et al. developed a client-server technique to allow\nusers to test networks to which they are currently attached [5],\nand operationalized a platform to track trends from February 2005\nto April 2009 [6]. This system required a user to download and\nexecute the client software once per measurement, limiting coverage. In 2017, Lone et al. used fve paid crowd-sourcing platforms\nto collect SAV measurements over a six-week period [33]. They\npaid platform fees of \u2248 2,000 Euros to have workers execute 1519\nSpoofer measurements from 91 countries and 784 unique ASes, 342\nof which the Spoofer project had not measured. They reported that\nthe observed spoofability in these measurements was similar to the\nvolunteer-based Spoofer system.\nOn inference of spoofng from other data sources. To overcome the requirement for a vantage point in every network, over the\nlast few years researchers have investigated creative opportunistic\ntechniques to infer lack of SAV in other macroscopic Internet data\nsets. In 2017, Lone et al. reported a technique to infer evidence of\nspoofed trafc in massive traceroute archives, based on the knowledge that an edge network should not appear to provide transit in\na traceroute path [34]. This method is also limited by what appears\nin the traceroute archives, as well as by the inconsistent addressing\nconventions used in traceroute implementations.\nAlso in 2017, Lichtblau et al. used a large Internet Exchange\nPoint (IXP) as a vantage point for inferring which networks had not\ndeployed SAV [30]. They compared source IP addresses of packets\nan IXP member sent across the IXP fabric with the range of source\naddresses expected based on routes observed using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). This approach faced challenges of accurately\ninferring ranges of source addresses expected for a given AS, and\nobtaining cooperation of the IXPs to access trafc data. The authors\ndid not use the data for remediation.\nEfectiveness of remediation attempts. Several studies have\nshown the difculty in efecting remediation of vulnerabilities via\nnotifcation, even for vulnerabilities that pose risks to the notifed\nnetworks themselves, as opposed to the rest of the Internet. Stock\net al. found a marginal improvement in remediation rate due to notifcation of 44,000 vulnerable web sites; a key obstacle was getting\nthe notifcation to the right person in the organization [52]. Li et al.\nfound a similarly daunting result, that the most efective approach\nwas to notify contacts registered in WHOIS [14] via a message with\ndetailed information about a vulnerability [28]. Such notifcations\nhad a statistically signifcant impact on improving remediation (11%\nmore contacts remediated than in the control group), but only a\nminority took any remediative action, often only partial, and repeat\nnotifcations had no efect. Reporting vulnerabilities through Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) organizations appeared to\nbe of limited utility. Hastings et al. found even more disappointing\nresults in their study of the response to disclosure of an RSA private\nkey compromise for 0.5% of HTTPS-enabled Internet hosts [20].\nIn a diferent study on remediation of hijacked websites, Li et al.\nreported that browser interstitials and search engine warnings correlated with faster remediation compared to private notifcation\nvia WHOIS contact alone [29].\n3 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE\nThe Spoofer system consists of client software, a set of vantage\npoints for receiving spoofed packets sent by the client, and a server\nfor coordinating measurements and sending spoofed packets to the\nclients, illustrated in fgure 1. Measurements collected prior to 2016\nwere sparse across both time and space (topology) [6]. Because users\nhad to manually run a program requiring root access, many prefxes\nand ASes had only a single test run from them. Since August 2015,\nwe undertook development eforts to reduce or remove barriers\nto operating the measurement client and obtaining measurement\ndata, and outreach eforts to promote both testing and deployment\nof SAV. Table 1 summarizes the major improvements we made, and\nsome of the outreach to network operators at industry meetings.\nFirst, the client now has a digitally signed install package available for all major desktop operating systems (Windows, MacOS,\nand Linux) as well as OpenWRT, and is also provided as open source.\n\u000f\u001a\u0019\u0019\u0014\u0013\u001b\n\u001c\u0013\u001b\u001f\u0013\u001b\n\u000f\u001a\u0019\u0019\u0014\u0013\u001b\n\u0011\u0016\u0015\u0013\u0018\u001d\n\u000f\u001a\u0019\u0019\u0014\u0013\u001b\n\u001b\u0013\u0011\u0013\u0015\u001f\u0013\u001b\u001c\n\u0011\u0019\u0018\u001d\u001b\u0019\u0016\u0001\u0011\u0019\u0018\u0018\u0013\u0011\u001d\u0015\u0019\u0018\n\u0001\u0015\u0018\u0010\u0019\u001e\u0018\u0012\n\u001d\u0019\u0001\u0011\u0016\u0015\u0013\u0018\u001d\n\u0019\u001e\u001d\u0010\u0019\u001e\u0018\u0012\n\u0014\u001b\u0019\u0017\u0001\u0011\u0016\u0015\u0013\u0018\u001d\n\f\u000f \b\b\u000b\n\n\u0005\u000b\u0006\u0004\u0006\u0004\u0006\b\n\n\u0018\u001d\u0013\u001b\u0018\u0013\u001d\n\u000e\u0005 \u000e\u0004\n\u000e\u0007\n\u000e\u0006\nFigure 1: Overview of Spoofer project architecture, consisting of client software, a server to coordinate measurements,\nand a series of receivers to collect packets sent by clients.\nMay 2015 Project re-launched.\nFeb 2016 Client allows user to share test results publicly.\nMay 2016 New client released, with GUI and automated\nprobing via daemon.\nMay 2016 Begin sending private notifcations.\nOct 2016 Present at North American Network Operators\u2019\nGroup (NANOG) meeting.\nDec 2016 Probing speed improvements in client.\nMar 2017 Begin testing SAV inbound to client.\nBegin testing granularity of IPv6 SAV flters.\nOct 2017 Begin testing location of IPv6 SAV flters.\nApr 2018 Begin monthly geo-scoped emails to network\noperator groups.\nJun 2018 Release OpenWRT client.\nSep 2018 Deploy new NAT testing mode.\nDec 2018 Halt private notifcations.\nTable 1: Timeline of Spoofer project since re-launch.\nThe client includes a GUI to present results in English, communicates extensibly and securely to our server using protobuf and TLS,\nand has the ability to automatically update itself. Ideally the project\nwould provide a Spoofer App for Android or iOS, but neither platform provides the ability to construct packets with spoofed source\naddresses unless the device is jailbroken.\nSecond, instead of requiring a user to manually initiate tests, the\nclient is now a daemon that runs tests automatically, periodically\ntesting at most weekly by default, and also whenever the client\nattaches to a network it has not tested previously. The daemon\nincreases not only the spatial coverage of the data, but also the\ntemporal coverage, allowing richer and more confdent inferences\n(\u00a75). The client performs a handshake to receive a list of work items\nto do, such as send spoofed packets to a set of cooperating addresses,\nconduct traceroutes towards those addresses, and listen for spoofed\npackets with specifc source IP addresses that the server sends to\nthe client to test fltering of packets inbound to the client network.\nASes\n(d) Unique per\u2212month\n(c) Cumulative\nNew Phase\nIPv6/40 IPv6/40\nSlashdot\n(a) Cumulative\n(b) Unique per\u2212month\nNew Phase\nASes\nIPv4/24 IPv4/24\nASes ASes\nIPv4/24\nIPv6/40\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n\u201918\nJan\n\u201916\nJan\n\u201914\nJan\n\u201912\nJan\n\u201910\nJan\n\u201908\nJan\n\u201906\nJan\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\nASes\nIPv6/40\nASes\nIPv4/24\n7K\n6K\n5K\n4K\n3K\n2K\n1K\n0\n80K\n60K\n40K\n20K\n0\n1.2K\n0.8K\n0.4K\n0\n\u201918\nJan\n0\n1K\n2K\n3K\n4K\n5K\n0\n0.2K\n0.4K\n0.6K\n0.8K\n1.0K\n\u201916\nJan\n\u201914\nJan\n\u201912\nJan\n\u201910\nJan\n\u201908\nJan\n\u201906\nJan\n7K\n6K\n5K\n4K\n3K\n2K\n1K\n0\nASes\nASes\nFigure 2: Growth in coverage of IP prefxes and ASes measured by the Spoofer project over time, from the beginning of the\nproject in 2005 until August 2019.

The B\u00e9zier\ncurve shows the trend that the percentage of private tests\ngrew from 5.2% of tests in June 2017, to 10.9% in May 2019.\nThird, we expanded the testing capabilities of the client software.\nThe handshake allows the server to determine if the client is operating from behind a Network Address Translation (NAT) router, and\nour system includes novel tests to evaluate SAV limitations in NAT\nimplementations (\u00a76.1). The client software now tests both IPv4\nand IPv6 on all platforms, including SAV granularity and location\nin the network (\u00a76.2). Our system also tests fltering of spoofed\npackets inbound to the client\u2019s network, using packets from the\nSpoofer server with a source address from the client\u2019s network \u2013\n192.0.2.0/24 in fgure 1. The presence of a NAT prevents our testing\nof the client\u2019s ability to receive spoofed packets because the NAT\ndevice cannot know to forward these packets to the client system.\nFinally, to promote SAV deployment, the project now publicly\nshares test results with anonymized IP addresses on the project\nwebsite, and privately shares unanonymized IP addresses with\nIPv4 and IPv6 ASes\nCountry Tested Spoofable\nUnited States 1316 25.4% 27.6%\nBrazil 494 9.5% 55.1%\nNetherlands 255 4.9% 29.4%\nGreat Britain 217 4.2% 29.5%\nRussia 202 3.9% 19.3%\nCanada 171 3.3% 29.2%\nGermany 167 3.2% 28.1%\nIndia 155 3.0% 27.1%\nAustralia 148 2.9% 25.0%\nBangladesh 131 2.5% 23.7%\nOther: 2409 46.5% 28.8%\nTotal: 5178 31.5%\nTable 2: Number of ASes with prefxes geolocated to a given\ncountry between May 2016 and August 2019 in our data.

The Spoofer client prompts the user for their\nsharing preferences when it is frst launched. For public reporting,\nwe anonymize IP addresses by concealing at least the last eight bits\nof the address \u2013 i.e., for IPv4 addresses we publicly provide the frst\n24 bits of the address. For IPv6 addresses, we publicly provide the\nfrst 40 bits, as ISP operators may use DHCP prefx delegation to delegate prefxes between 48 and 64 bits to individual subscribers [40].\nBeginning April 2018, we sent geographically-scoped public emails\nto regional network operator group mailing lists to encourage remediation when we had tests from ASes in the geographic region\nshowing SAV had not been deployed in at least some networks in\nthe region. To mitigate privacy concerns that might hinder adoption\nand use of the Spoofer client, client reports to the Spoofer system\ndo not include any unique identifer.\nThe project\u2019s eforts to lower barriers to running the test have\nhad a measurable impact on coverage of Spoofer measurements (fgure 2). Prior to the release of the probing daemon in May 2016, the\nproject collected approximately 23k successful test sessions across\n11 years, an average of 174 sessions per month. In the following\n39 months ending August 2019, the project collected more than\n414k sessions, averaging 10,639 sessions per month, i.e., two orders\nof magnitude more sessions per month than before the probing\ndaemon was released, resulting in the project acquiring 17.75 times\nmore data in 29.5% of the time. Measurement coverage of the global\nInternet topology has similarly increased, from 3410 IPv4 ASes\nto 6938 \u2013 10.6% of the globally routed ASes as of August 2019 \u2013\nwith 3528 ASes newly observed since May 2016. IPv6 coverage has\nincreased from 211 ASes to 980 \u2013 6.3% of globally routed IPv6 ASes\nas of August 2019 \u2013 with 769 ASes newly observed since May 2016.\nFigure 3 shows that 5-10% of users opt-out of publicly sharing their\ntest results, or privately sharing IP addresses with operators. The\ngrowth in private tests beginning in April 2018 is correlated with\nwhen the Spoofer project began sending geographically-scoped\npublic emails to regional network operator group mailing lists,\nsuggesting these public emails prompted operators to use the tool\nthemselves, but that they did not want their results to be public.\nThe Spoofer system annotates each test by geolocating the client\u2019s\nIP address at collection time using NetAcuity Edge. Table 2 shows\nthe top 10 countries by number of ASes represented in our data,\nwhere each AS had an IPv4 or IPv6 prefx geolocated to the country\nthat a client tested since the probing daemon was released in May\n2016. Overall, we have tested at least one prefx in 5,178 ASes, with\n31.5% of these ASes having at least one prefx that was spoofable.\n34.9% of ASes were geolocated to one of two countries: the U.S.,\nwith 25.4% of the tested ASes, and Brazil with 9.5%. More than half\nof the ASes tested within Brazil did not block spoofed packets in\nat least one test, making Brazil an outlier in our data. We discuss\nremediation activity within the U.S. and Brazil in \u00a77.",
    "answer": "The paper \"Network Hygiene, Incentives, and Regulation: Deployment of Source Address Validation in the Internet\" presents related work on the prevalence of spoofed-source Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and the promotion of source address validation (SAV) deployment. The authors cite research from 2000 and 2001 where researchers proposed methods to trace back the source of spoofed packets, but none have seen deployment due to operational and coordination costs. They also mention a 2017 survey of 84 operators that confirms the lack of resources required to accurately maintain SAV filtering. The authors also mention various academic research efforts that have described techniques to promote deployment of SAV, including the Internet Society's MANRS initiative, the US National Institute for Standards and Technology's evaluation of the performance impact of deploying various types of reverse path filtering in commercial routers, and the authors' own previous research on crowd-sourced measurement of SAV deployment. The authors also mention recent research on inferring spoofing from other data sources and the effectiveness of remediation attempts.",

    "prompt": "Given the FAQ below, I would like to generate a knowledge graph from it. Can you provide me the steps to do it?\n\nQ. What is \u201cPay with Miles/Mix Miles and Cash\u201d?\nA. \u201cPay with Miles\u201d (PwM)/Mix Miles with Cash is the project enabling KrisFlyer (KF) members to use their KF miles as payment or partial payment of their commercial tickets and selected ancillaries on singaporeair.com (SAA).\nQ. How will this payment method benefits KF members?\nA, Members will be able to use this payment option for all commercial booking classes available on SAA, which means that they will have access to all available seats on all flights operated by SIA. Members will also have control over the number of miles they want to use, as long as it is more than the minimum required. Members will have more opportunities to use their miles before expiry. \nQ. What is the minimum number of miles required to pay for a commercial ticket?\nA. A minimum of approximately 1050 KF miles is required per transaction (i.e., per PNR). This minimum may vary as the conversion rate from SGD to KF miles is subject to change upon review. For information only: The conversion rate is stored as SGD 1: 105 KF miles, hence the KF miles deducted for such a transaction will always be in multiples of 105 miles.\nQ. Is there a maximum number of miles which is allowed to be used?\nA. No, members can pay up to 100% of the commercial ticket using miles (inclusive of airport taxes and surcharges).\nQ. If members do not have enough miles, can they purchase miles to pay for tickets?\nA. No, purchase of miles is only available when redeeming award tickets or flight upgrades.\nQ. Will members be able to use their miles to pay for taxes and surcharges on their commercial tickets?\nA. Yes, members will be able to use their miles to pay for airport taxes and surcharges of their commercial tickets bought on SAA. \nIn other words, the entire commercial ticket can be paid for with miles.\nQ. Can members use their miles to pay for the tickets of their friends and family?\nA. Members can use their miles to pay for the commercial tickets of their nominees (RGN) only. Members can nominate up to a maximum of 5 RGNs. Nominees can be added at any time. However, once added, these RGNs cannot be removed or changed for a period of 6 months and a fee is applicable.\nQ. Can members use their miles to pay for flights on another airline?\nA. No, members are only able to use their miles for SIA operated flights. If members were to purchase an itinerary on SAA which includes a codeshare flight operated by another airline, they would also be unable to use KF miles to pay for the SIA operated flight within that itinerary.\nQ. Can members use KF miles to pay for a booking made through a travel agent?\nA. No, the KF miles payment option is only available for KF members via SAA. \nQ. For transactions in foreign currencies, would the cash component be rounded up or down? Would it be rounded off to the nearest dollar?\nA. Itineraries originating from outside Singapore will be priced in local currencies (as per current SAA logic), and the local fares will be converted to SGD (based on the IATA rounding logic) before being converted to KF miles. \nQ. What is the SGD to miles conversion rate?\nA. The current conversion rate is SGD1per 105 KF miles. This rate will be reviewed periodically and is subject to change. \nQ. Will the SGD to miles conversion rate be made known to members?\nA. The conversion rate will not be explicitly made known to members on SAA (both on the content pages and the booking flow). However, if members were to enquire about the conversion rate or about the monetary value of the miles in their accounts, you can share that the conversion rate is currently SGD1 per 105 KF miles. Members can then work out the value of their miles and the amount they wish to use. Please note that this conversion rate will be reviewed periodically and is subject to change. \nQ. Will members be able to accrue PPS Value, Elite miles and KF miles if they use their miles as payment for their commercial ticket?\nA. Yes, KrisFlyer and Elite miles will be earned, in proportion to the fare (excluding airport taxes) paid using credit/debit card if the fare is mileage accruable. The PPS Value accrued will similarly be derived from the proportion paid using credit/debit card. The current conditions for accruing and calculating PPS Value still apply. As a result of this logic, the KF miles used to pay for a transaction will first be used to offset all the airport taxes of all the tickets before being used to offset the fare and fuel surcharges of the tickets. Please note that Elite miles and KF miles accrued on tickets that are partially paid for using KF miles can only be accrued to KF account. The miles accrued on such tickets cannot be parked with any other OFFPs.\nQ. Will members be able to opt to accrue miles for other KF members before themselves?\nA. No, we have optimized the accruals to benefit the principal member (the member who has used his/her miles to purchase the tickets). Members will not be able to adjust this logic.\nQ. Can members accrue miles to OFFP accounts?\nA. No, the miles earned from a commercial ticket paid for with KF miles can only be credited to their KF accounts. \nQ. Are these tickets subject to any special conditions?\nA. Yes, commercial tickets paid for with KF miles are strictly non-endorsable, even if the purchased fare is one which is fully endorsable. Other than that, the prevailing commercial conditions associated with the fare paid will be applicable.\nQ. Are redemption upgrades allowed for tickets that are paid for with KF miles?\nA. Yes, redemption upgrades are allowed for tickets that are paid for with KF miles as long as the commercial fare is in an upgradeable booking class.\nQ. Will members be able to make changes to their tickets paid for with KF miles on SAA?\nA. For flight or itinerary changes, members will have to contact their local SIA office or call centres. Any additional collection resulting from these changes can only be paid for using credit card/debit card/cash. Fare conditions will apply. Members will be able to submit their request for booking changes via SAA which will be routed offline for handling. These requests will be routed based on the POS for that transaction. For seat and meal requests, members will be able to self-service on SAA. \nQ. Can a ticket paid for with KF miles be issued by AROs/call centres?\nA. Offline assistance is to be provided to the passenger for exceptional handling only.\nQ. How do we service a customer when SAA is down?\nA. This payment feature is only available on SAA. As a result, if SAA is down, KF miles will not be an available payment option at that time. Member will be able to continue to complete the transaction offline, but payment must be made using credit/debit card. \nQ. Will members be able to go back onto SAA to do seat and meal requests after their bookings are reissued offline?\nA. Yes, as per all commercial tickets, members can make seat and meal requests on SAA for their tickets paid for with KF miles even if they have been reissued offline by AROs/call centres. \nQ. Can tickets paid for with KF miles be refunded on SAA?\nA. Yes, as per all other commercial tickets, tickets paid for with KF miles can be submitted for refunds on SAA if the tickets are completely unflown and have not been reissued. The maximum amount paid using credit/debit card will be refunded to members first (not exceeding the original amount paid using credit/debit card). The balance will then be refunded accordingly in miles. KF miles that have expired, will not be refunded.\nQ. How will the refund be handled for cancellations of a ticket paid for with miles?\nA. If refunds are applicable, then the maximum possible amount of the fare paid using credit/debit card (but not more than the original amount paid using credit/debit card) will be refunded first. The remaining refund amount, if any, will be returned in equivalent miles. In other words, we will always refund the \u201ccash\u201d amount first (not exceeding the original amount paid using credit/debit card), before refunding the KF miles. This logic also applies to the refund of residual value when a ticket is reissued from a higher fare to a lower fare. KF miles that have expired, will not be refunded.\nQ. Will residual miles be refunded for reissuance from higher fares to lower fares?\nA. For a booking change from a higher fare to a lower fare, the refund logic will apply to the residual value. In other words, we will always refund the \u201ccash\u201d amount first (not exceeding the original amount paid using credit/debit card). Any balance refund amount will then be refunded in miles. KF miles that have expired will not be refunded.\nQ. What happens if some miles used to pay for the flight have already expired at the point of refund?\nA. The expired miles will not be refunded. Only miles which have not expired can be refunded. Any applicable fees and charges associated with the refund will be deducted from the oldest miles used for the ticket. I.e., Expired miles will be used to deduct such charges first. \nQ. How can we verify whether the miles the member used to pay for the flight have already expired?\nA. Information on the expiry of the miles used for tickets is available in the transaction record in MARMS. Alternatively, once the refund mask has been created in Altea, the information is displayed as a response from MARMS. Members will also be advised of this if they submit their tickets for refund on SAA. \nQ. How can members submit their tickets paid for with miles for refund?\nA. Members can either submit their tickets for refund on SAA or they may contact their nearest SIA office to do so. For tickets submitted for refund offline, these tickets must be refunded by the original issue station. \nQ. When will the miles be credited back to members\u2019 accounts when they submit their tickets paid for with miles for refund?\nA. The miles will be returned to members\u2019 account immediately once the refund is successfully completed. \nQ. If members have purchased a commercial ticket paid fully with credit/debit card, will they be able to use miles to pay for any additional collection resulting from a reissuance?\nA. No, this new payment option is only available on SAA for new ticket issuance. \nQ. Will members be able to use their miles to pay for any other services available on SAA?\nA. No, KF miles are only available as a payment method for commercial tickets. We are working on increasing the list of SIA services members can use their KF miles to pay for. \nQ. Can members use their miles to pay for the taxes and surcharges on their redemption award tickets?\nA. No, members can only use their miles to pay for commercial bookings (including taxes and surcharges) made on SAA. We are working on enabling members to pay for taxes and surcharges on their redemption tickets in the next phase of development.\nQ. When can members use their KF miles to pay for taxes and surcharges on their redemption tickets or for any other SIA services?\nA. We are working on enabling members to use their miles to pay for (i) taxes and surcharges on their redemption tickets and (ii) other SIA services. This will be in the next phase of development.\nQ. Will OFFP members (e.g., LH Miles & More member using LH miles) be able to use their own miles from their respective FFP programmes if they are not KF members?\nA. No, only KF miles can be used for this new payment option. Hence, only KF members (who accrue KF miles) will be able to use this payment option. \nQ. Can member continue to use their KF miles to redeem Saver, Standard and Full Award tickets?\nA. Yes, we will continue to maintain the current redemption options for members. This is an additional programme feature which will increase the number of options for members to make use of their miles.\nQ. Is it better to use KF miles to pay for a commercial ticket or redeem an award ticket?\nA. The number of miles required to pay for a commercial ticket depends on the fares available at the time of purchase. Customers are advised to check the mileage requirement for both the commercial ticket and the Award redemption, as well as to consider the applicable fare conditions before deciding which ticket type is more suitable for their purpose.\nQ. Will members be able to pay for an infant ticket with miles?\nA. Currently, infant nominees are not available in the dropdown list on SAA. However, once this feature is made available on the commercial booking flow, members will be able to pay for their infant tickets with miles.\nQ. Will members be able to make a booking for himself and/or his nominees and other passengers who are not his nominees?\nA. Yes, however, members will only be able to use their miles to pay for the tickets for themselves and their nominees. They will have pay for the tickets of any other passengers using credit/debit card. \nQ. For tickets paid for with miles with itineraries starting from MI destinations, will MI be able to service (reissue/revalidate/refund) these tickets?\nA. No, as these tickets involve the collection of miles, they will have to be routed to SQ for handling. This is similar to the handling of redemption tickets. \nQ. When voiding a reissue of a ticket originally paid for with miles, the FOP for the reissue must be deleted before attempting another reissue. Why is this so?\nA. MARMs will return an approval code for all reissue ticket and this approval code is appended into the FOP field. When the reissue ticket is voided, a void message is sent to MARMs and the approval code will be invalidated by MARMS. Hence, if the FOP is not deleted, Altea will use the same approval code to issue the new ticket and this new ticket number will not be updated by MARMS. Subsequent servicing such as reissue or refund will fail since MARMS has no record of this new ticket.\nQ. Why is voiding the refund of a ticket originally paid for with miles not allowed even when sales report is not closed yet?\nA. Like a redemption ticket, Altea does not send any void message to MARMs for voiding of a refund record for tickets originally paid with miles. Hence, MARMs will not be aware that the refund is voided and subsequent attempt to refund the ET will fail.\nQ. How can members submit their tickets paid for with miles for refund?\nA. Members can either submit their tickets for refund on SAA or they may contact their nearest SIA office to do so. For tickets submitted for refund offline, these tickets must be refunded by the original issue station. \nQ. Why must refund of tickets, which has been paid with miles, always be refunded by original issue station?\nA. If refund is done by a different station, BBR will be used to convert refundable amount to the refund station currency. However, MARMS only stores IATA exchange rate. Hence, there is a possibility that the converted amount using BBR may be higher that the converted rate by MARMS, thus resulting in refund failure. \nQ. For tickets paid for with miles, cover refund is permitted for a flown ticket but not an already refunded ticket. Why is this so?\nA. Altea will make a call to MARMs for all refund of tickets which has been paid for with miles. MARMs will have a record that the ticket is already refunded, hence further refund will not be allowed. MARMS has no record that the ticket is flown, hence cover refund is still allowed for flown ticket.\nQ. Zero refund is not allowed for tickets paid for with miles. Why is this so?\nA. MARMS expects to receive the FOP details for tickets paid for with miles in the refund message from Altea. However, there is no FOP for zero refund, hence zero refund is not allowed for ticket, which has been paid with miles. For reissue of tickets paid for with miles, only cash is allowed if additional fare is required. Why is FQTR still a mandatory element for such reissues and also reissue without adc as well? MARMS need the FQTR number from Altea in order to create the MARMs record for the reissue transaction.\nQ. If the member wants to use 100% of the miles for his own ticket only, can he select \"Not a nominee\" in the passenger details and manually type in his RGN's details?\nA. The logic for accruals has been defaulted to always favour the principal member. The principal member will always accrue full miles before the nominee (also a KF member) accrues any miles. In the event the principal member would like to use miles to pay for his own ticket and not his nominee, he may choose not to select his nominee from the dropdown list. Instead, he could choose 'Not a nominee' and enter the 2nd pax details manually, he will not be able to use miles for this 2nd pax. In this case, the principal member will get either partial/no accrual while pax 2 will get full accrual. \nQ. Why a residual value eMD, that is issued against a ticket paid for with miles, cannot be reissued into another ET or eMD? \nA. Such reissue is not in scope for phase 1. MARMs will return an error message to Altea and reissue will fail. Hence, the eMD must be submitted for refund. This will be reviewed by LMD in phase 2.",

Yes, KrisFlyer and Elite miles will be earned, in proportion to the fare (excluding airport taxes) paid using credit/debit card if the fare is mileage accruable. The PPS Value accrued will similarly be derived from the proportion paid using credit/debit card. The current conditions for accruing and calculating PPS Value still apply. As a result of this logic, the KF miles used to pay for a transaction will first be used to offset all the airport taxes of all the tickets before being used to offset the fare and fuel surcharges of the tickets. Please note that Elite miles and KF miles accrued on tickets that are partially paid for using KF miles can only be accrued to KF account. The miles accrued on such tickets cannot be parked with any other OFFPs.\nQ. Will members be able to opt to accrue miles for other KF members before themselves?\nA. No, we have optimized the accruals to benefit the principal member (the member who has used his/her miles to purchase the tickets). Members will not be able to adjust this logic.\nQ. Can members accrue miles to OFFP accounts?\nA. No, the miles earned from a commercial ticket paid for with KF miles can only be credited to their KF accounts. \nQ. Are these tickets subject to any special conditions?\nA. Yes, commercial tickets paid for with KF miles are strictly non-endorsable, even if the purchased fare is one which is fully endorsable. Other than that, the prevailing commercial conditions associated with the fare paid will be applicable.\nQ. Are redemption upgrades allowed for tickets that are paid for with KF miles?\nA. Yes, redemption upgrades are allowed for tickets that are paid for with KF miles as long as the commercial fare is in an upgradeable booking class.\nQ. Will members be able to make changes to their tickets paid for with KF miles on SAA?\nA. For flight or itinerary changes, members will have to contact their local SIA office or call centres. Any additional collection resulting from these changes can only be paid for using credit card/debit card/cash. Fare conditions will apply. Members will be able to submit their request for booking changes via SAA which will be routed offline for handling. These requests will be routed based on the POS for that transaction. For seat and meal requests, members will be able to self-service on SAA. \nQ. Can a ticket paid for with KF miles be issued by AROs/call centres?\nA. Offline assistance is to be provided to the passenger for exceptional handling only.\nQ. How do we service a customer when SAA is down?\nA. This payment feature is only available on SAA. As a result, if SAA is down, KF miles will not be an available payment option at that time. Member will be able to continue to complete the transaction offline, but payment must be made using credit/debit card. \nQ. Will members be able to go back onto SAA to do seat and meal requests after their bookings are reissued offline?\nA. Yes, as per all commercial tickets, members can make seat and meal requests on SAA for their tickets paid for with KF miles even if they have been reissued offline by AROs/call centres. \nQ. Can tickets paid for with KF miles be refunded on SAA?\nA. Yes, as per all other commercial tickets, tickets paid for with KF miles can be submitted for refunds on SAA if the tickets are completely unflown and have not been reissued. The maximum amount paid using credit/debit card will be refunded to members first (not exceeding the original amount paid using credit/debit card). The balance will then be refunded accordingly in miles. KF miles that have expired, will not be refunded.\nQ. How will the refund be handled for cancellations of a ticket paid for with miles?\nA. If refunds are applicable, then the maximum possible amount of the fare paid using credit/debit card (but not more than the original amount paid using credit/debit card) will be refunded first. The remaining refund amount, if any, will be returned in equivalent miles. In other words, we will always refund the \u201ccash\u201d amount first (not exceeding the original amount paid using credit/debit card), before refunding the KF miles. This logic also applies to the refund of residual value when a ticket is reissued from a higher fare to a lower fare. KF miles that have expired, will not be refunded.\nQ. Will residual miles be refunded for reissuance from higher fares to lower fares?\nA. For a booking change from a higher fare to a lower fare, the refund logic will apply to the residual value. In other words, we will always refund the \u201ccash\u201d amount first (not exceeding the original amount paid using credit/debit card). Any balance refund amount will then be refunded in miles. KF miles that have expired will not be refunded.\nQ. What happens if some miles used to pay for the flight have already expired at the point of refund?\nA. The expired miles will not be refunded. Only miles which have not expired can be refunded. Any applicable fees and charges associated with the refund will be deducted from the oldest miles used for the ticket. I.e., Expired miles will be used to deduct such charges first. \nQ. How can we verify whether the miles the member used to pay for the flight have already expired?\nA. Information on the expiry of the miles used for tickets is available in the transaction record in MARMS. Alternatively, once the refund mask has been created in Altea, the information is displayed as a response from MARMS. Members will also be advised of this if they submit their tickets for refund on SAA. \nQ. How can members submit their tickets paid for with miles for refund?\nA. Members can either submit their tickets for refund on SAA or they may contact their nearest SIA office to do so. For tickets submitted for refund offline, these tickets must be refunded by the original issue station. \nQ. When will the miles be credited back to members\u2019 accounts when they submit their tickets paid for with miles for refund?\nA. The miles will be returned to members\u2019 account immediately once the refund is successfully completed. \nQ. If members have purchased a commercial ticket paid fully with credit/debit card, will they be able to use miles to pay for any additional collection resulting from a reissuance?\nA. No, this new payment option is only available on SAA for new ticket issuance. \nQ. Will members be able to use their miles to pay for any other services available on SAA?\nA. No, KF miles are only available as a payment method for commercial tickets. We are working on increasing the list of SIA services members can use their KF miles to pay for. \nQ. Can members use their miles to pay for the taxes and surcharges on their redemption award tickets?\nA. No, members can only use their miles to pay for commercial bookings (including taxes and surcharges) made on SAA. We are working on enabling members to pay for taxes and surcharges on their redemption tickets in the next phase of development.\nQ. When can members use their KF miles to pay for taxes and surcharges on their redemption tickets or for any other SIA services?\nA. We are working on enabling members to use their miles to pay for (i) taxes and surcharges on their redemption tickets and (ii) other SIA services. This will be in the next phase of development.\nQ. Will OFFP members (e.g., LH Miles & More member using LH miles) be able to use their own miles from their respective FFP programmes if they are not KF members?\nA. No, only KF miles can be used for this new payment option. Hence, only KF members (who accrue KF miles) will be able to use this payment option. \nQ. Can member continue to use their KF miles to redeem Saver, Standard and Full Award tickets?\nA. Yes, we will continue to maintain the current redemption options for members. This is an additional programme feature which will increase the number of options for members to make use of their miles.\nQ. Is it better to use KF miles to pay for a commercial ticket or redeem an award ticket?\nA. The number of miles required to pay for a commercial ticket depends on the fares available at the time of purchase. Customers are advised to check the mileage requirement for both the commercial ticket and the Award redemption, as well as to consider the applicable fare conditions before deciding which ticket type is more suitable for their purpose.\nQ. Will members be able to pay for an infant ticket with miles?\nA. Currently, infant nominees are not available in the dropdown list on SAA. However, once this feature is made available on the commercial booking flow, members will be able to pay for their infant tickets with miles.\nQ. Will members be able to make a booking for himself and/or his nominees and other passengers who are not his nominees?\nA. Yes, however, members will only be able to use their miles to pay for the tickets for themselves and their nominees. They will have pay for the tickets of any other passengers using credit/debit card. \nQ. For tickets paid for with miles with itineraries starting from MI destinations, will MI be able to service (reissue/revalidate/refund) these tickets?\nA. No, as these tickets involve the collection of miles, they will have to be routed to SQ for handling. This is similar to the handling of redemption tickets. \nQ. When voiding a reissue of a ticket originally paid for with miles, the FOP for the reissue must be deleted before attempting another reissue. Why is this so?\nA. MARMs will return an approval code for all reissue ticket and this approval code is appended into the FOP field. When the reissue ticket is voided, a void message is sent to MARMs and the approval code will be invalidated by MARMS. Hence, if the FOP is not deleted, Altea will use the same approval code to issue the new ticket and this new ticket number will not be updated by MARMS. Subsequent servicing such as reissue or refund will fail since MARMS has no record of this new ticket.\nQ. Why is voiding the refund of a ticket originally paid for with miles not allowed even when sales report is not closed yet?\nA. Like a redemption ticket, Altea does not send any void message to MARMs for voiding of a refund record for tickets originally paid with miles. Hence, MARMs will not be aware that the refund is voided and subsequent attempt to refund the ET will fail.\nQ. How can members submit their tickets paid for with miles for refund?\nA. Members can either submit their tickets for refund on SAA or they may contact their nearest SIA office to do so. For tickets submitted for refund offline, these tickets must be refunded by the original issue station. \nQ. Why must refund of tickets, which has been paid with miles, always be refunded by original issue station?\nA. If refund is done by a different station, BBR will be used to convert refundable amount to the refund station currency. However, MARMS only stores IATA exchange rate. Hence, there is a possibility that the converted amount using BBR may be higher that the converted rate by MARMS, thus resulting in refund failure. \nQ. For tickets paid for with miles, cover refund is permitted for a flown ticket but not an already refunded ticket. Why is this so?\nA. Altea will make a call to MARMs for all refund of tickets which has been paid for with miles. MARMs will have a record that the ticket is already refunded, hence further refund will not be allowed. MARMS has no record that the ticket is flown, hence cover refund is still allowed for flown ticket.\nQ. Zero refund is not allowed for tickets paid for with miles. Why is this so?\nA. MARMS expects to receive the FOP details for tickets paid for with miles in the refund message from Altea. However, there is no FOP for zero refund, hence zero refund is not allowed for ticket, which has been paid with miles. For reissue of tickets paid for with miles, only cash is allowed if additional fare is required. Why is FQTR still a mandatory element for such reissues and also reissue without adc as well? MARMS need the FQTR number from Altea in order to create the MARMs record for the reissue transaction.\nQ. If the member wants to use 100% of the miles for his own ticket only, can he select \"Not a nominee\" in the passenger details and manually type in his RGN's details?\nA. The logic for accruals has been defaulted to always favour the principal member. The principal member will always accrue full miles before the nominee (also a KF member) accrues any miles. In the event the principal member would like to use miles to pay for his own ticket and not his nominee, he may choose not to select his nominee from the dropdown list. Instead, he could choose 'Not a nominee' and enter the 2nd pax details manually, he will not be able to use miles for this 2nd pax. In this case, the principal member will get either partial/no accrual while pax 2 will get full accrual. \nQ. Why a residual value eMD, that is issued against a ticket paid for with miles, cannot be reissued into another ET or eMD? \nA. Such reissue is not in scope for phase 1. MARMs will return an error message to Altea and reissue will fail. Hence, the eMD must be submitted for refund. This will be reviewed by LMD in phase 2.",

    "prompt": "This is the first 15 mins of a sales call: \"> Stephen Donohoe 00:00\nHave you been lazy? Did you have a nice weekend.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 00:03\nStill recovering from the flu. We've got flu brains here. All of us. Dealing with the weather change. And there's the influenza going around. And just not recovering too quickly from it so.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 00:19\nGoing to keep my camera off again. Stephen sorry.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 00:22\nI was thinking this one. You said maybe today I'll do better and turn my camera on. But feeling like ships. Sorry.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 00:29\nNo, that's quite our ice. And don't worry about it.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 00:32\nAre you starting to improve it all? Or is it kind of hanging around.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 00:37\nSo the minute I stock a few battle. You know. My kids, then get it. And then they give it back to me. And then we're just kind of. Reinfecting each other quite conveniently. Here. Recovering for a bit and then getting. Sick again. So it's been a bit weird because here, like we spoke the last time. Stephen is getting warmer.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 01:07\nAnd then we have a bit of sandstones that comes in from Saudi.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 01:11\nAnd normally when those samsungs come and everyone's going down. With. Virals in Dubai. So that's the situation hereby.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 01:21\nYeah. Okay. And the dance trials, they can just come out of nowhere, can't they.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 01:26\nOut of nowhere take over the entire city. Reduce visibility people with asthma Dust allergies. They just get so unwell normal people as well, because it comes to the acs. So even if we're in those and we think we're safe because it's like the fine dust it comes through the AC, the AC ventilation, and then.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 01:50\nYeah? There's no escape? No escape.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 01:54\nHopefully you start to get on the mend.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 01:56\nAnd soon enough I know it's. I don't. Have kids myself. I know, Kurt. You do. But from what I hear is, yeah, it can be quite cyclical. And these illnesses, they can just keep going around.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 02:11\nAbsolutely. So but. It's it's good. I mean, there's good to have company in misery. So it's okay. Lizzy, I can relate.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 02:26\nNo, no, I can relate. It seems like seems like we've had something in our house since November. So just. I have three little kids. They're four, eight and nine. And so. One of them will get it passed to one of the parents, and then just it just goes around like you said. But I'm really hoping 2023 is a year where we have like one week without anyone being sick.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 02:55\nSharing is caring.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 02:56\nMy kids are way older. My kids are 18. My daughter turned 18. Two weeks ago. And my son is 16. But it never changes. It's always the same scenario. Sharing is caring, and then they start blaming each other. Typical sibling site. Well, they're more social at that age, too.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 03:20\nSo it's easy to keep my fouryearold daughter at home if she's sick. But, you know, understand. I remember being 18, and it was a harder to keep me up in the house.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 03:29\nAbsolutely. Yeah. That's my situation right now. So we think we're getting better. And then two days later, we're down with this And it's really bad Cox and fevers and body aches. So it's a nasty, nasty viral that has definitely evolved into a superbug. That's what the doctors are seeing in Dubai as well. There was a news article yesterday that said the influenza. Bug has evolved into a superbug. So. Yep, it's fun. We're having a party hand by.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 04:01\nExciting times.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 04:06\nI was super excited after the last meeting. I love what Carry has to offer. Was even sharing that with Nathan. I love the analytics, I love the AI. Element to it as well. I love your dashboards. So exciting. So really looking forward to today as well.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 04:26\nOkay. Awesome. I'm glad to hear I didn't do a terrible job then. First some context. Curse is one of our solution engineers here as well. Lizzy. So. We can with curtain when Natan comes on as well, we can jump in or we can hold on for another couple of minutes. That's totally up to you, but we can start diving into some of the detail in specifically around. The consumption piece. I know that's an element to the business, but we can keep it pretty fluid as well. And if there's anything top of mind that you want to cover. Yeah. Do field questions, Curtis. Certainly the brains behind the operation here. So. You're well supported.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 05:12\nWhat I didn't see the last time, but I'm sure it's on clarity is like a Kp. dashboard. You know, apart from the Salesforce. That's. Then it's fantastic. There's also the Kpi dashboards that is currently. Managed manually. You know, in excel and with formulas. And then, of course, we recently converted those to Power Bi. But. Does clarity have. A version also that showcases. Like a scope of a comparative performance. Chart showing. Kpis. Kpi. Performance. Between each sales rep and then rolled up to the sales leader. There's something like that. On Clari.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 06:05\nSo. We can I suppose the short answer is yes, but requires a caveat that we would just need to understand specifically what it is that you're referring to. I think one thing that would be really helpful as well. At some point we can get a mutual mda in places, but just to get some visibility over the kpis that you're tracking and how you're visualizing that in excel. And in Power bi and we can see if it's that we can put together in a dashboard. I'm not sure karate have there's any additional context that you would kind of add there.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 06:38\nI think you nailed it. I mean, it's just about understanding what kpis are tracked. And there's probably several different ways we can support that. And Clari. The forecast module comes to mind where because you mentioned roll up. Right. So it's just understanding what formulas that you're using today, in which metrics that you're interested in tracking and then. Most of our customers, what they do is they'll have. Steven, I'm sure you let them know that in clarity you're not limited to one view of the forecast. So let's just say you have your sales global sales forecast in clarity. You could have a separate Kpi dashboard or Kpi based roll up where it's less about. Okay, well, what's the commit and upside, right?\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 07:24\nIt's more about here's the here of the sales reps and the frontline manager.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 07:28\nAnd maybe we're tracking asp's sales cycle link thing like things like that and rolling that.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 07:36\nYou all of that. Yep. That's exactly what I'm talking about.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 07:39\nCool. I need to. Hey, guys.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 07:42\nHey, Stephen. Hey, cut. Sorry I got tied up on a on another call, which is actually about this. Let's get.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 07:51\nNo worries at all have you been. Yeah.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 07:53\nVery good. Thanks. Very good. How about yourself? Yeah. Keep them.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 07:56\nWell, thank you. Keep them well. I just thought I'd mention as well. I'm not sure if you saw the email came through, but I put together just an intro for yourself and Johnny from compliance. He just shared his calendar there. They've been a customer for a few years. By the way, similar stack to you. They use kaia and Outreach for top of funnel as well. They do.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 08:20\nInteresting. They they do use kaya.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 08:22\nYeah. I think they use Outreach for tapa funnel. And for kaya, they might even use it for more. But I think that's it and then Clarity for kind of forecasting, pipeline management, things like that. But Johnny is very familiar with the Clarity platform, so definitely a good person to speak to.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 08:38\nSure. Yeah. I'll try and connect with him this week. I saw you share this calendar there, so hopefully get a chance to sync up.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 08:44\nOkay. Cool. Well, if you need my help at all, just let me know. And yeah, outside of that and me curse and curse one of our solution engineers here. So as I was saying to Lizzie, there definitely the brains behind the operation between the two of us. So be good to kind of dive into some of the more. Yeah tactical and detail stuff around the forecasting especially consumption today.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 09:06\nAbsolutely nice to meet you. Hi, Nathan. Nice to meet you as well.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 09:11\nHow you doing. Yeah. Doing great, man. Doing great.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 09:15\nExcited. Use case here around your Usage product. Based in Philadelphia. I've been with Clari for about three years and typically focus on Enterprise forecasting, deployments. So we have had a couple customers come through with the consumption use case. And so Stephen tapped me to consult on what you guys are doing, so hopefully we can help you out with Larry.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 09:41\nTrust. So look, I suppose by way of an agenda for the call today, we've got another 35 minutes set aside and thought it'd best just to kind of keep this pretty conversational. I mean, we can potentially jump in and show you elements of clarity as well, if needs be. I suppose the most important thing is that we get a full understanding for how you're currently. I suppose. Forecasting and measuring, but also then hosting data around that consumption piece as well so that we can kind of go away and put together a couple of different options and see if we can find a solution that's going to work for you on that. So yeah, I suppose maybe over to you initially to just give a little bit of an overview. Maybe. Nathan, Lizzie around how you're currently reporting. On that consumption at the moment. And I'm sure Kurt will have a few questions as we go. Or unless Krista was something that you wanted to kind of kick off with.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 10:32\nNothing to present, but if we could start at a high level and just understand the gotomarket approach for that product. And then how you're reporting and forecasting on that that would be very helpful.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 10:47\nYeah, no problem. I'll have a swing at them. So the product in question is called Martrus. So it's. A Payments business. You can see it more as like a fintech play. Not too dissimilar to like revolute or Monzo or you know, some of these kind of popular. He kind of more ewlowerdriven solutions that you see nowadays. So the go to market approaches like our vertical. Across all of our products is within shipping. So when we talk about that, it's like. Transportation Companies that move product by see. On Large tanker, bulk vessels. Right. And so the Martros product is aimed at the seafarers, because that's where the volume is in terms of.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 11:40\nPersonnel.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 11:42\nSo here's what selling to a shipping company. Who are responsible for those seafarers onboard vessels. And really the. Kind of three main products that we would try and sell into a shipping company. One is. The Crew Payment solution. So.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 12:02\nEvery time you pay your seatbearer, which typically once a month.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 12:07\nAnd even any of your employees. But more typically, the seafarers is where the value proposition makes sense. We would basically charge you $12 flat on that transaction. Right. Because those seeds bearers are typically getting paid in local currency. So that's a once a month transaction. And then. And this is where it gets a little bit complex. So that's quite predictable. That's a beta B type cell, right. Every Cfare is going to get paid every month.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 12:40\nPretty.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 12:41\nThere's then a B to B to C element because of our E wallet solution, which is once you paid those cf errors, they can also take advantage of our E wallet solution. And that helps them send money back home to their families. Right. So if the Cfarer decides to take that up. Then we typically see another $1212. Plus a small amount of fx revenue. So you could say $15 on when they paid or when they make another bank to bank transfer, which is typically like one or two. It's normally one to family back home. Right. And then you have card usage, which is like point of sale atma type transactions on that card. But that's going to be like really small fx revenue, which is tiny.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 13:34\nBut.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 13:36\nIt does make up part of the like the revenue portfolio for ewallet, but again really difficult to forecast people use for it but just want to kind of paint the picture and then the other the other. Part the mantra solution is kind of like whilst we're talking to you, we could also handle your vendor payment. So when you pay vendors. It'll be a same same platform. Ultimately, what are we doing? We're making payments faster with fewer transaction fees. With a much better compliance platform kind of wrapped around it. And again, we're going to find around $15 there per transaction when they pay their customers. So the vendor payments is quite predictable. If the customer give us their volume. We know the fee that we're going to get per, you know, bank to make transfer.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 14:24\nThe crew payments is quite predictable.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 14:27\nI just need to know how many crew you got and just confirm you pay them once a month. Is really tricky because that's that B to be to C element. Like, how many times are they gonna send money back home per month. How many times are they going to do atm withdrawals? They're buy a packet cigarettes. So they're gonna go and buy like a new car. Like.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 14:53\nJust really difficult.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 14:54\nAnd obviously we're making a few dollars on the fx as well every time they spend. And so, yeah, it's high. The average base that's highly, like. The challenge, as well as the ramp. So if you told me you've got 100 C fairs. Making. One payment, a month. $12 a month. That's quite easy for me to figure out what annually you're worth. Whatever. Right. But on the e wallet side. I don't know when your sea bearer is gonna choose to use it because they don't have to use it. No one can force them to use it if they don't want to. So like if you guys said, hey, we've got this amazing deal with revolution. If you use that card, you get all of these amazing perks. You might say I'm gonna stay with, like, Citibank. I'm not gonna use that. And so you're one less person that they have predicted that's just kind of dropped off, if that makes sense. But you never truly know when they're gonna drop off because there's no light optout or I want to say no. It's just like working with the accounts trying drive the doctrine. So as that ramp piece as well, which is which is which is tricky because we might say in accounts worth 100 grand and we sign them and we only find that within twelve months we found like 30 grand because we didn't get the adoption of the evolve.\n>\"",
    "answer": "It seems like the sales call started with some small talk about how the participants were feeling. Lizy Thomson mentioned that she and her family were still recovering from the flu and were dealing with the weather change. Stephen Donohoe asked if she was starting to improve or if the flu was hanging around. They also talked about how illnesses can keep going around in families and how Dubai has been experiencing a nasty viral that has evolved into a superbug. After the small talk, Stephen Donohoe mentioned that Curt Weaver, one of their solution engineers, was also on the call. Lizy Thomson expressed her excitement about what their company, Carry, has to offer, particularly the analytics and AI element, as well as the dashboards. Stephen Donohoe suggested diving into some of the details, specifically around the consumption piece, but also noted that they could keep the conversation pretty fluid.",

It says it takes \"at least\" two weeks - do you have any idea if it will be 2 weeks or longer? \nAccording to the Consult Gerneral in US, it said nornmally it will only take 4 work days. Although this is a very old post but I looked through the website and did not see they post any new annoucement about the processing time, so I think this annoucement is still valid. However, I think Chinese Embassy are a bit strict these days so may take more time to get a visa than usual. (Adeh took 2-3 monthes to apply for a reunion visa for his son Yaoyao last year which is super annoying)\nFor me, which is better? To use my US passport or my Dutch passport?\nThe only doable visa for both of you are Business visa, so please do business visa for yourself too. I think it does not matter which passport you use. \nThank you. I'm looking through the requirements and the application.

Testing stations are being removed from city streets. The enforcers of \u201czero-covid\u201d are nowhere to be found. In China\u2019s battle against covid-19, the state has disappeared from the front lines. For nearly three years President Xi Jinping tried to contain the virus, calling his efforts a \u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d. Now he has surrendered and the people must live with the enemy. Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android. Mr Xi is not the first leader to conclude that such a fight was unwinnable. But before ditching their zero-covid policies, other countries first took pains to administer vaccines, stockpile antiviral drugs and draw up treatment guidelines. China had ample time to do all of that. Yet more than two years after the first vaccine proved effective, the country remains ill-prepared. That has made opening up much more dangerous than it ought to be. How dangerous? In this week\u2019s China section we publish our model of how the epidemic might play out. It comes with essential caveats. Modelling an epidemic is difficult. Modelling one in China, where the data are often unreliable, is even harder. We take into account variables such as vaccination rates, the effectiveness of Chinese jabs, the lethality of covid for different age groups and the number of intensive-care beds. In a worst case, if covid spreads freely and many people cannot get care, we estimate that in the coming months 1.5m Chinese people will die from the virus. Although that is a lower share of the population than in many rich countries, it is still a criticism of the government\u2019s poor preparations. It is also a call to action. A vaccination drive will take months. The government has waited too long to build and staff new icus. But even if the state will not impose lockdowns while it prepares, it can mitigate the number of deaths. It should start by protecting the health system. A wave of covid is breaking over China. Our model sees this peaking in January. By that time hospitals risk being overwhelmed. Beds and staff are a precious resource to be husbanded. That means keeping people who are not seriously ill away from hospitals. To that end, the state could help drug companies restock pharmacies that run out of such things as lateral-flow tests and paracetamol. Medical staff should be vaccinated first and they must be given the proper gear to minimise the risk of infection. A second step is to ensure cheap and plentiful supplies of covid drugs. Dexamethasone, a low-priced steroid, has been shown to reduce deaths among the most severely ill patients. Antivirals, such as Paxlovid, help keep those most at risk out of hospital. These drugs have become part of the toolkit doctors around the world are using to fight the virus. They could save many thousands of lives in China. Only the government knows if it has enough of them to go around. If not, it should start stocking up. Foreign governments would surely send supplies if China asked. President Xi Jinping should not let his pride imperil China\u2019s people, as he has done by shunning more efficacious Western vaccines. China\u2019s vaccines still work. So the third priority is to get them into people\u2019s arms. It may be too late for many in this wave, but there will be others. Less than half of those over 80 years old have had three shots, the number needed for decent protection against severe disease and death. Yet some of the elderly have gone to the clinic for a jab only to be turned away for lack of supplies. Until recently, some vaccine factories were sitting idle. Vast quantities will be needed. Six-monthly booster shots ought to become a normal part of life for older Chinese. As the state has failed to do its job, people are helping themselves. Masks are ubiquitous in many cities and more people are working from home. Restaurants and cinemas may be open, but in cities such as Beijing they remain largely empty. All this will help slow the growth of this covid wave and ease the pressure on hospitals. But the government must also act. In a country the size of China, even small steps could save many lives.\" From the article above, I find the following sentences most interesting: 1. \"President Xi Jinping tried to contain the virus, calling his efforts a \u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d\" 2. \"A wave of covid is breaking over China.

Facing a surge in COVID-19 cases, China is setting up more intensive care facilities and trying to strengthen hospitals as Beijing rolls back anti-virus controls that confined millions of people to their homes, crushed economic growth and set off protests. Just a few months ago Chinese people had little fear of catching covid-19. The government\u2019s \u201czero-covid\u201d measures kept them safe for the most part. Mass testing and strict lockdowns contained the virus. If a person did test positive, the government would swoop in. The infected were taken to state-run quarantine centres. If symptomatic, they were treated in a designated hospital. Health workers would douse their house with disinfectant and test their neighbours. All this changed on December 7th, when the central government largely ditched its zero-covid policy, lifting most restrictions. Six days later it scrapped an app that tracked people\u2019s movements. The highly transmissible Omicron variant had made zero-covid unsustainable. Now the public is expected to fend for itself. \u201cBe the first person responsible for your own health,\u201d wrote the People\u2019s Daily, a Communist Party mouthpiece. Some residents of Beijing have received letters from the local committees that used to enforce covid controls. Stop reporting fevers and coughs to us, one read, before wishing people good luck. \u201cThank you for the past three years of support and understanding.\u201d The official number of new cases is falling, as if the virus were fading away. But official numbers are no longer reliable because the government has scaled back testing. If it has an alternative way of keeping tabs on the epidemic, it is not sharing it. Still, it is pretty clear that a covid wave is building, as people share stories of infection online. An informal survey has been circulating on social media asking Beijing residents if they have caught the virus. As The Economist went to press, 39% of the 434,000 or so respondents had said yes. Such surveys are striking, not just for the numbers. A few months ago people who had caught covid were stigmatised. They might, for example, struggle to find jobs after recovering. Now the disease is so common that people are posting their test results on social media, often substituting for the word \u201cpositive\u201d a cartoon of a sheep (which is a Chinese homophone for positive). Others are sharing lighthearted advice about the best time to catch covid. An infection now or in early January, for example, might clear up in time for a person to enjoy both Christmas and the lunar new year. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t I positive yet?\u201d complained one young woman in a video. Others, though, are worried. Until recently the government told people that covid was to be feared. Now the official line is that Omicron is no worse than the flu. Infected people who are not showing serious symptoms have been encouraged to stay at home and treat themselves. Not everyone is listening. Beijing\u2019s emergency-call operators have been swamped by over 30,000 calls a day, about six times the average. Queues have appeared outside fever clinics in several cities. Certain medicines are in short supply. On December 13th a health-care website began selling Paxlovid, a highly effective antiviral drug used to treat covid. Its initial stocks sold out in half an hour. Hospitals are under more stress as doctors and nurses catch the virus. There are reports that some medical workers who have tested positive have been asked to come in anyway, risking more transmission within hospitals. As of December 13th Beijing had 50 severely ill patients, according to the official numbers. So far, the health system does not appear to be overwhelmed. But the peak of this wave is still some way off. It will probably come in late January, at least in Beijing, says Ben Cowling, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong. With the government changing its message, people are looking elsewhere for guidance. Overseas Chinese students who have experience with covid are sharing advice on WeChat, a social-media app. They tell people what symptoms to expect and how long they might last. In general, though, good information on the virus is lacking. There are reports of people going to hospital after taking too much fever medicine. Herbal remedies used to combat covid are in hot demand, though doctors doubt their effectiveness. Vaccines, not voodoo At least people now see the need to protect themselves against the virus, which was once viewed as a terrifying but distant threat. More are getting vaccinated. The number of jabs administered each day has increased from fewer than 200,000 to over 1m. But there is a lot of ground to make up, especially when it comes to the most vulnerable. Only around 40% of people over 80 have received the three doses needed to significantly reduce the chances of severe disease or death. Yet some elderly people have had trouble getting a shot because of a lack of supply at clinics. People are also taking steps that will help mitigate the spread of the disease and perhaps reduce the pressure on hospitals. In Beijing the shopping centres and streets are largely empty, as people stay inside. Call it a self-imposed lockdown. People who do venture out wear n95 masks (which are good at filtering small airborne particles). Demand for home deliveries of meals and groceries has shot up. But people are still making plans to travel back to their villages and home towns for the lunar new year in late January. Data from Ctrip, a booking platform, show that the volume of searches for flights has increased by 160% since the government loosened restrictions. Searches for train tickets on Baidu, a search engine, increased by nearly 600% during that time. Many rural areas are woefully unprepared to handle a surge in cases. When the peak of this wave approaches, \u201cit would make a lot of sense to bring back some public-health measures,\u201d says Mr Cowling. But reversing course may be hard for the government to justify without admitting that it had made a mistake.\" From the article above, I find the following sentences most interesting: 1. \"lifting most restrictions. Six days later it scrapped an app that tracked people\u2019s movements\" 2. \"Now the public is expected to fend for itself. \u201cBe the first person responsible for your own health,\u201d wrote the People\u2019s Daily\" 3. \"But official numbers are no longer reliable because the government has scaled back testing\" 4. \"A few months ago people who had caught covid were stigmatised. They might, for example, struggle to find jobs after recovering.\" 5. \"Beijing\u2019s emergency-call operators have been swamped by over 30,000\" Article: \"China pushes vaccines as retreat from 'zero-COVID' turns messy. Beijing urges inoculations for elderly WHO calls for vaccine drive as virus spreads Economic summit starts amid more dire data BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Dec 15 (Reuters) - China raced to vaccinate its most vulnerable people on Thursday in anticipation of waves of COVID-19 infections, with some analysts expecting the death toll to soar after it eased strict controls that had kept the pandemic at bay for three years. The push comes as the World Health Organisation also raised concerns that China's 1.4 billion population was not adequately vaccinated and the United States offered help in dealing with a surge in infections. Beijing last Wednesday began dismantling its tough 'zero-COVID' controls, dropping testing requirements and easing quarantine rules that had caused anxiety for tens of millions and battered the world's second largest economy. The pivot away from President Xi Jinping's signature \"zero-COVID\" policy followed unprecedented widespread protests against it. But, WHO emergencies director Mike Ryan said infections were exploding in China well before the government's decision to phase out its stringent regime. \"There's a narrative at the moment that China lifted the restrictions and all of a sudden the disease is out of control,\" Ryan told a briefing in Geneva. \"The disease was spreading intensively because I believe the control measures in themselves were not stopping the disease.\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Thursday China has \"institutional advantages\" to fight COVID. \"We will certainly be able to smoothly get through the peak of the epidemic,\" he told a regular news briefing in response to White House national security spokesperson John Kirby saying that the United States was ready to help if China requested it. There are increasing signs of chaos during China's change of tack - including long queues outside fever clinics, runs on medicines and panic buying across the country. On Thursday night, China's state asset regulator urged state-backed big drugmakers to ensure supplies of COVID-related medicines. The companies include China Resources, China General Technology and Sinopharm, which own businesses that produce drugs that could ease coronavirus symptoms. One video posted online on Wednesday showed several people in thick winter clothes hooked up to intravenous drips as they sat on stools on the street outside a clinic in central Hubei province. Reuters verified the location of the video. The COVID scare in China also led people in Hong Kong, Macau and in some neighbourhoods in Australia to go in search for fever medicines and test kits for family and friends on the mainland. For all its efforts to quell the virus since it erupted in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019, China may now pay a price for shielding a population that lacks \"herd immunity\" and has low vaccination rates among the elderly, analysts said. \"Authorities have let cases in Beijing and other cities spread to the point where resuming restrictions, testing and tracing would be largely ineffective in bringing outbreaks under control,\" analysts at Eurasia Group said in a note on Thursday. \"Upward of 1 million people could die from COVID in the coming months.\" Other experts have put the potential toll at more than 2 million. China has reported just 5,235 COVID-related deaths so far, extremely low by global standards. China's stock markets and its currency fell on Thursday on concerns of the virus spread. China reported 2,000 new symptomatic COVID-19 infections for Dec. 14 compared with 2,291 a day. The official figures, however, have become less reliable as testing has dropped. It also stopped reporting asymptomatic figures on Wednesday. CONCERN FOR ELDERLY China, which has said around 90% of its population is vaccinated against COVID, has now decided to roll out the second booster shot for high-risk groups and elderly people over 60 years of age. National Health Commission spokesperson Mi Feng said on Wednesday it was necessary to accelerate the promotion of vaccinations, according to comments reported by state media. The latest official data shows China administered 1.43 million COVID shots on Tuesday, well above rates in November of around 100,000-200,000 doses a day. In total, it has administered 3.45 billion shots. Vaccinations in China have been ramping up in recent days. The latest official data shows it administered 1.43 million shots on Tuesday, well above rates in November of around 100,000 - 200,000 doses a day. Vaccinations in China have been ramping up in recent days. The latest official data shows it administered 1.43 million shots on Tuesday, well above rates in November of around 100,000 - 200,000 doses a day. But one Shanghai care home said on Wednesday a number of its residents have not yet been vaccinated and considering their underlying medical condition, it has barred visitors and non-essential deliveries while stockpiling medicines, tests kits and protective gear. \"We are racking our brains on how to ensure the safety of your grandparents,\" the Yuepu Tianyi Nursing Home wrote in a letter posted on its official WeChat account page. Beijing has been largely resistant to western vaccines and treatments, having relied on locally-made shots. Pfizer's (PFE.N) oral COVID-19 treatment Paxlovid is one of the few foreign ones it has approved. The treatment, however, has only been available in hospitals for high-risk patients, but signs have appeared in recent days that it may soon be made more widely available. China Meheco Group Co Ltd's stock jumped (600056.SS) after it announced a deal to import the U.S. drugmaker's treatment on Wednesday. ECONOMIC CONFERENCE As the virus spreads, President Xi, his ruling Politburo and senior government officials began a two-day meeting to plot a recovery for China's battered economy, according to sources with knowledge of the matter. China's economy lost more steam in November as factory output growth slowed and retail sales extended declines, both missing forecasts and clocking their worst readings since May, data on Thursday showed. Economists estimate that China's growth has slowed to around 3% this year, marking one of China's worst performances in almost half a century.\" From the article above, I find the following sentences most interesting: 1. \"Upward of 1 million people could die from COVID in the coming months.\" 2. \"Other experts have put the potential toll at more than 2 million.\" 3. \"China administered 1.43 million COVID shots on Tuesday, well above rates in November of around 100,000-200,000 doses a day.

    "answer": "This code appears to define a macro called `SORT` that performs a series of sorting and data manipulation operations on a data set called `MBSF_ABCD_SUMMARY_&year`. The macro takes a year as its input argument, and the data set name is constructed by concatenating the year with the string `MBSF_ABCD_SUMMARY_`.\n\nThe `SORT` macro first sorts the data set by the `PATIENT_ID` variable and creates a new data set called `MBSF_AB_SUMMARY_&year`. It then renames a number of variables in the new data set, and removes any rows where the `PATIENT_ID` variable is missing or blank.\n\nThe macro then sorts another data set called `MBSF_ABCD_SUMMARY_&year` by `PATIENT_ID` and creates a new data set called `MBSF_D_CMPNTS_&year`.\n\nThe code then defines another macro called `extract` that appears to perform additional data manipulation and merging operations on the data sets created by the `SORT` macro. The `extract` macro takes three input arguments: `lib`, `yr`, and `year`. It is not clear from the code you've provided how these input arguments are used or what the resulting data sets contain.\n\nIt is also not clear from the code how the `SORT` and `extract` macros are being used to obtain a list of patients who were continuously enrolled one year in advance of their diagnosis date. To accomplish this task, you may need to modify the code to include additional conditions or calculations based on the enrollment and diagnosis dates of the patients.",

    "answer": "Listing Name: Updated Uptown Dallas House - 2 Miles to Downtown!\nListing Location: District 14\nListing Amenity List: Entire home/apt, 2 bedrooms, 72 amenities\nListing Property Type: House\nLikely Reason for Success: This listing is likely to be successful because of its location in Uptown Dallas, which is a popular and upscale area with a lot of demand for housing. The house is also updated, which will appeal to renters who want a modern and comfortable place to stay. Additionally, the fact that it is only 2 miles from downtown Dallas makes it a convenient option for those who want to be close to the city center.\nLikely Price of the Property to Purchase Versus Lease: It is difficult to estimate the price of the property without more information, but given the high demand in Uptown Dallas, it is likely to be a relatively expensive property both to purchase and to lease.",
