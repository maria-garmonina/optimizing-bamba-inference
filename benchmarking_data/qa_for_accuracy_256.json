With this feature, customers and prospects can easily reply to SMS messages to confirm an action, rather than having to go to a URL or enter a code elsewhere. This added layer of security can also thwart man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and prevent the use of stolen account credentials gained through phishing and other means.\n\nOur 2-way SMS inbound feature can be used in a variety of ways to benefit our customers. For example, it can be used to handle HELP/STOP responses from customers for ARN/MKT traffic. If a customer sends a STOP response, it must be posted to the callback URL provided by the customer for an actual opt-out of future alerts. Additionally, the STOP response from the end user must trigger an automated opt-out SMS response (which can be managed by TeleSign or the customer's CSM). Similarly, a HELP response from the end user must trigger an automated HELP message (which can also be managed by TeleSign or the customer's CSM).\n\nThis feature also allows for 2-way communications between the end user and the business (our customer). It can be used for transaction verification, such as funds transfer, account change confirmation, and login authentication. Additionally, it can be integrated with SSL VPN for added security. With the 2-way SMS inbound feature, TeleSign is able to provide our customers with a secure and convenient way to communicate with their end users.",

This error is occurring because the `_main_window` attribute is not defined as a class attribute, but rather as an instance attribute.\n\nTo fix this error, you should first get an instance of the `App` class by calling the `App` constructor with an `Application` object as an argument.

[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nThis is just one small step but one we can do quickly and I think will refocus people's attention to how much they can accomplish within Google. Any thoughts?\n\n--Sergey",
    "answer": "It looks like Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google, is concerned about employee retention at the company. He believes that the popularity of Facebook is leading Google employees to want to start their own social networking companies or create popular apps, which could contribute to a retention problem. Brin also mentions that he feels that high performers at Google have not been sufficiently rewarded. He suggests implementing a \"Founder's Award\" program as a way to refocus employees' attention on their work at Google and to recognize and reward high performance. It's unclear from this email what specific actions the executive management team, including Marissa Mayer, might take in response to these concerns.",

    "prompt": "Hi, I have machine learning problem that I'd like to ask. Let's assume I have a series of online courses and let's label them as O1, O2, O3 ... ON. These online courses are short module of psychotherapy. Then, I have many clients who receive psychotherapy from us, let's label them as C1, C2, C3 ... CN respectively. Each client will go take one course a week, lasting for 8 weeks, and let's label the time they take the course as T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8 respectively. At T1, the client will take a comprehensive psychological test that test for their personality, life satisfaction and what challenges that they're facing, and at T8 the client will take the same test again to measure any changes in their psychological condition. My goal is to build a recommender system take is able to take into account of the test taken in T1, such as their personality and challenges that they're facing, and recommend a sequence of online courses to be taken each week, to maximise the improvement in the psychological test taken at T8. Please advise how to achieve this.",
    "answer": "To build a recommender system that can take into account the test taken in T1 and recommend a sequence of online courses to maximize the improvement in the psychological test taken at T8, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Data collection and preprocessing: Gather data on the online courses, clients, and their psychological test results at T1 and T8. Preprocess the data by cleaning, normalizing, and transforming it into a format suitable for machine learning models.\n2. Feature engineering: Extract features from the data that can be used to train the machine learning models. Features could include client demographics, course characteristics, and psychological test results at T1.\n3. Modeling: Train a machine learning model that can predict the improvement in the psychological test results at T8 based on the course sequence. This can be achieved by using a supervised learning approach, where the model is trained on past client data to predict the improvement in psychological test results at T8.\n4. Recommender system: Once the machine learning model is trained, you can use it to build a recommender system that recommends a sequence of online courses to maximize the improvement in the psychological test results at T8. The system can take into account the client's psychological test results at T1 and recommend a sequence of courses that are most likely to improve their psychological condition by T8.\n5. Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the recommender system by testing it on a holdout set of client data. Measure the improvement in the psychological test results at T8 for clients who followed the recommended course sequence and compare it to the improvement for clients who did not follow the recommended sequence.\n6. Iteration and improvement: Use the results from the evaluation to refine and improve the recommender system. This could involve retraining the machine learning model with new data or incorporating additional features into the model.\n\nOverall, building a recommender system that takes into account a client's psychological test results at T1 and recommends a sequence of online courses to maximize the improvement in their psychological test results at T8 is a complex task that requires careful data collection, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation. However, with the right approach and tools, it is possible to create a system that can help clients improve their mental health through personalized online courses.",

We will discuss the importance of algorithm design and analysis and explain the key concepts and terminology used in this subject.\n\n1.2 Algorithm\n\nAn algorithm is a set of instructions that is used to solve a particular problem. It is a well-defined procedure that takes some input and produces a corresponding output. Algorithms can be expressed in various forms, such as natural language, flowcharts, pseudocode, or programming languages.\n\n1.3 Design and Analysis of Algorithm\n\nThe design and analysis of algorithm are concerned with creating and analyzing efficient algorithms that can solve problems in an optimal manner. The design of an algorithm involves developing a step-by-step procedure to solve a particular problem, while the analysis of an algorithm involves evaluating its efficiency in terms of time and space complexity.\n\n1.4 Complexity of Algorithm\n\nThe complexity of an algorithm is a measure of the resources it consumes in terms of time and space. Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to complete its execution, while space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to store its intermediate results.\n\n1.5 The Importance of Algorithm Design and Analysis\n\nEfficient algorithms are essential for solving complex problems in various fields such as computer science, engineering, mathematics, and science.

    "answer": "Both methods seem to be calculating the Spearman correlation coefficient between the number of asylum applications ('asyl\\_app') and the rejection rate ('rejection\\_rate'). However, there are some differences in how the data is being aggregated in each method.\n\nIn the first method, the data is grouped by 'app\\_country' and aggregated by summing the values for 'app', 'rejected', and 'asyl\\_app'. The rejection rate is then calculated for each country, and the Spearman correlation coefficient and p-value are computed using these aggregated values. This method gives you the correlation between the number of asylum applications and rejection rate for each country.\n\nIn the second method, the data is first grouped by both 'app\\_country' and 'year', and the same aggregation is performed as in the first method. Then, the rejection rate is calculated for each country and year. The data is then grouped again by 'app\\_country' and 'year', and the mean rejection rate and number of asylum applications are calculated for each group. Finally, the Spearman correlation coefficient and p-value are computed using these mean values. This method gives you the correlation between the number of asylum applications and rejection rate for each country, while also considering the year-wise data.\n\nBetween the two methods, the second one is more statistically sound. The reason is that the second method takes into account the variation in the data over the years, which provides a more robust estimation of the correlation. By considering the year-wise data, the second method accounts for potential changes in trends over time and is therefore a better representation of the relationship between the number of asylum applications and the rejection rate.",

    "answer": "The use of `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor()` to execute `method1()` and `method2()` concurrently is a good approach to improve the performance of the Flask API. However, there are a few improvements that could be made to the code:\n\n1. Use of a function decorator to specify the HTTP method and URL route of the API endpoint.\n2. Use of the `concurrent.futures.as_completed()` method to avoid blocking the main thread while waiting for the results.\n3. Use of the `concurrent.futures.wait()` method to wait for all the futures to complete, instead of waiting for each future individually.\n\nHere's an updated version of the code incorporating these improvements:\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, jsonify\nimport concurrent.futures\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\ndef method1(data):\n    # code for method 1 to make API call and get results\n    return results1\n\ndef method2(data):\n    # code for method 2 to make API call and get results\n    return results2\n\ndef make_api_call(method, data):\n    if method == 'method1':\n        results = method1(data)\n    elif method == 'method2':\n        results = method2(data)\n    return results\n\ndef concurrent_api_call():\n    data1 = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}\n    data2 = {'key3': 'value3', 'key4': 'value4'}\n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n        futures = [executor.submit(make_api_call, 'method1', data1),\n                   executor.submit(make_api_call, 'method2', data2)]\n    results = {}\n    for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):\n        method = 'method{}'.format(futures.index(future) + 1)\n        results[method] = future.result()\n    return results\n\n@app.route('/api')\ndef api():\n    results = concurrent_api_call()\n    return jsonify(results)\n```\nIn this updated code, the `concurrent_api_call()` function creates a list of futures using the `executor.submit()` method and then uses the `concurrent.futures.as_completed()` method to iterate over the futures as they complete.

    "answer": "This bash script takes a list of file names as input arguments and performs the following operations:\n\n1. It first takes the first argument and stores it in a variable called \"DEFINES\".\n2. It then takes the second argument and stores it in a variable called \"ENTRY\".\n3. It then takes the third argument and stores it in a variable called \"COMMAND\".\n4. It uses the \"cat\" command to concatenate the contents of all the files specified by the remaining input arguments and pipes the output to the \"grep\" command.\n5. The \"grep\" command searches for lines in the input that begin with the string \"entrypoint\" and pipes the output to the \"sed\" command.\n6. The \"sed\" command uses regular expressions to replace the string \"entrypoint\" followed by a space and a function name with a C-style function declaration that takes an integer and a pointer to a character constant array as arguments. The resulting output is then appended to the file specified by the \"DEFINES\" variable.\n7. The \"grep\" command is again used to search for lines that begin with the string \"constructor\", and the output is piped to the \"sed\" command.\n8. The second \"sed\" command again uses regular expressions to replace the string \"constructor\" followed by a number and a function name with a C-style function declaration that takes no arguments. The resulting output is then appended to the file specified by the \"DEFINES\" variable.\n9. An empty line is added to the file specified by the \"DEFINES\" variable.\n10. A conditional statement is written to the file specified by the \"ENTRY\" variable. The condition checks if the program name specified by the \"COMMAND\" variable matches the name of the program being executed. If it does, the statements following the conditional block are executed.\n11. The \"grep\" and \"sed\" commands are used again to extract the function names from the \"constructor\" lines and write them as function calls to the file specified by the \"ENTRY\" variable.\n12. Finally, the \"grep\" and \"sed\" commands are used again to extract the function name from the \"entrypoint\" line and write a function call to it with the appropriate arguments.\n\nOverall, this script appears to be processing a list of input files and generating C-style function declarations and calls based on certain patterns found in those files. It is likely intended to be used as part of a larger software build process.",

    "answer": "The code defines two classes, `ToHexGrid` and `HexMetrics`. `ToHexGrid` is a method that takes in a 2D position in the form of a `Vector2` object, converts it to hexagonal grid coordinates, and returns the result as a `Vector2Int` object.\n\nThe conversion from the 2D position to hexagonal grid coordinates is done through a series of mathematical operations. First, the x and y values of the input `Vector2` position are divided by the inner radius and outer radius of a hexagon, respectively. Then, these values are adjusted based on an offset calculated from the y value of the position.\n\nNext, the x, y, and z values of the hexagonal grid coordinates are rounded to integers using the `Mathf.RoundToInt` method. If the sum of these three values is not equal to 0, the code determines which of the values deviates the most from its rounded integer value, and adjusts that value to satisfy the equation x + y + z = 0.\n\nThe `HexMetrics` class defines two constants, `outerRadius` and `innerRadius`, which are used in the calculation of the hexagonal grid coordinates in the `ToHexGrid` method. The `outerRadius` is set to 10, and the `innerRadius` is calculated as 86.6% of the `outerRadius`.",

    "answer": "To move only a few changes from the develop branch to the prod-release branch, you can use Git cherry-pick. Cherry-pick is a Git command that allows you to apply a specific commit from one branch to another.\n\nHere's how you can use cherry-pick to move delta-1 and delta-3 from the develop branch to the prod-release branch:\n\n1. Make sure you have the latest changes from both the develop and prod-release branches by running the following commands:\n```r\ngit checkout develop\ngit pull\ngit checkout prod-release\ngit pull\n```\n2. Identify the commit hashes for delta-1 and delta-3 by running `git log` or checking the commit history on your Git hosting service (e.g. GitHub).\n3. Switch to the prod-release branch and run the cherry-pick command for each of the commits you want to move:\n```sql\ngit checkout prod-release\ngit cherry-pick <delta-1 commit hash>\ngit cherry-pick <delta-3 commit hash>\n```\n4. Resolve any conflicts that may arise during the cherry-pick process.\n5. Push the changes to the prod-release branch:\n```perl\ngit push origin prod-release\n```\nNote that cherry-picking specific commits from a branch to another branch can cause conflicts if the same code was modified in multiple commits. Therefore, it's recommended to perform this operation with caution and thoroughly test the changes before pushing them to the production environment.",

    "answer": "There are a few potential reasons that this code might be running slow:\n\n1. The while loop in the `solve` function runs until `len(tokens) > 1`, which means that it will continue to run until there is only one token left in the `tokens` list. This means that the loop will run for as many iterations as there are tokens in the list. If the `tokens` list is long, this could take a significant amount of time.\n2. The `simplify` function calls `tokens.index` twice, which involves searching through the entire `tokens` list for the specified element. This can be a time-consuming operation if the list is long.\n3. The `simplify` function also creates a new list by concatenating three sublists of `tokens` using slicing. This operation involves creating a new list and copying elements from the original list, which can also be time-consuming.\n\nTo improve the performance of this code, it might be worth considering the following options:\n\n1. Implementing a more efficient algorithm for solving the problem. For example, using a different data structure or implementing a more efficient search algorithm.\n2. Optimizing the `simplify` function to reduce the number of searches and list operations it performs.\n3.

    "prompt": "Social influence: \nThe role of social influence in healthcare is crucial, as it can have a significant impact on an individual's behavior and decision-making related to their health. In carePhysics, the principle of Behavioral Influence recognizes the importance of using various \"levers,\" such as social influence, to influence behavior change. Social influence can take different forms, including normative social influence, informational social influence, and mimetic influence, all of which can play a powerful role in shaping behaviors and decisions related to healthcare.\n\nOne of the most effective ways to leverage social influence is by involving friends and family in the care process. This can encourage positive actions and behaviors and create a sense of community support that can motivate patients to adopt healthier habits. Healthcare providers can also use social influences, such as educational videos or other media, to showcase positive behaviors and practices that are encouraged in healthcare.\n\nIt is important to recognize the impact of social influence on both patients and healthcare providers. Patients may follow the advice of their healthcare providers, friends, and family, while healthcare providers may be more likely to adopt new practices if they see their colleagues doing the same. By recognizing the power of social influence, healthcare providers can develop strategies that take advantage of this influence to achieve positive outcomes in care.",
    "answer": "Normative Social Influence:\nNormative social influence occurs when individuals conform to the expectations of others to gain approval, avoid disapproval, or maintain social harmony. In a healthcare context, patients may adhere to certain health behaviors or treatments if they perceive them as being approved by their healthcare providers, friends, or family members. Healthcare providers can harness normative social influence by creating a supportive environment that encourages healthy behaviors, demonstrating empathy, and reinforcing positive actions.\n\nInformational Social Influence:\nInformational social influence takes place when individuals look to others for guidance or information in uncertain situations. In healthcare, patients may turn to their healthcare providers, friends, family, or online communities for advice and information regarding their condition, treatments, or self-care. Healthcare providers can leverage informational social influence by offering accurate, timely, and evidence-based information to patients and their families, as well as by connecting them with relevant support groups and resources.\n\nMimetic Influence:\nMimetic influence, also known as imitation or modeling, occurs when individuals adopt the behaviors, attitudes, or actions of others whom they perceive as successful or desirable. In healthcare, patients may be more likely to adopt recommended practices if they see others, such as healthcare providers, friends, or family members, demonstrating these behaviors. Healthcare providers can utilize mimetic influence by modeling healthy behaviors and practices, sharing success stories of other patients, and encouraging peer support and mentorship among patients.\n\nBy understanding and leveraging the different forms of social influence, healthcare providers can develop strategies that effectively promote positive behavior change and improve health outcomes. Recognizing the power of social influence and incorporating it into healthcare interventions can lead to more successful and lasting improvements in patients' well-being.",

    "prompt": "Hello. I'm coding a Nx monorepo which contains two Angular applications and a Node Express server. This is related to the server side. I already have a common interface for a Project, that looks like this:\n\n```\ninterface Project {\n id: string; \n name: string;\n description: string;\n status: 'draft' | 'active' | 'archived'; \n owner\\_id: string; \n start\\_date: Date; \n end\\_date: Date; \n created\\_at: Date; \n updated\\_at: Date; \n}\n```\n\nI'd like to add persistance to my application, and use SQLite through sequelize-typescript. Now, the persistance layer should live in a `database/` directory in my Nx lib folder. In this folder, we should connect to the database, declare the classes, the tables, and the methods related to the model. Then, I want to import it to my Express application and call it from the project.controller. \n\nI don't need you to code anything right now; I just need you to point me where things are declared, what's the file structure, and how the sequelize model definitions should be available to the aforementioned controller without breaking encapsulation.\n1 / 1",
    "answer": "Here's a suggested file structure and how you can organize your code to achieve the desired functionality:\n\n1. Inside your Nx lib folder, create a new directory named `database`.\n2. Inside the `database` directory, create the following subdirectories and files:\n* `config/`: This directory will contain configuration files for different environments.\n\t+ `database.config.ts`: This file will export an object containing database configuration for various environments (e.g., development, production).\n* `models/`: This directory will contain your Sequelize model definitions.\n\t+ `project.model.ts`: This file will define and export the `ProjectModel` class, which maps to the `Project` interface.\n* `repositories/`: This directory will contain your data access layer classes.\n\t+ `project.repository.ts`: This file will define and export the `ProjectRepository` class, which encapsulates all the data access methods for the `Project` model.\n* `index.ts`: This file will export everything needed to interact with the database, including initializing Sequelize, connecting to the database, and exporting the repositories.\n1. Now, let's see how you can use the Sequelize model definitions in your Express application without breaking encapsulation:\n* Import the `ProjectRepository` class in your `project.controller.ts` file.\n* Inject an instance of the `ProjectRepository` class into your controller.\n* Use the repository methods to interact with the database.\n\nHere's an example of how the `project.controller.ts` might look like:\n```typescript\nimport { ProjectRepository } from '@your-nx-workspace/database';\n\nclass ProjectController {\n  private projectRepository: ProjectRepository;\n\n  constructor() {\n    this.projectRepository = new ProjectRepository();\n  }\n\n  async createProject(req, res) {\n    const newProject = await this.projectRepository.create(req.body);\n    res.status(201).send(newProject);\n  }\n\n  // ... other controller methods\n}\n```\nThis way, the database interaction and Sequelize model definitions are encapsulated within the `database` directory in your Nx lib folder. The Express application only interacts with the repositories, which provide a clean interface for data access.",

    "answer": "Banks and Metaverse\n\nThe advent of blockchain technology and digital currencies has paved the way for new opportunities in banking and financial services. Metaverse banking is a new form of banking that leverages blockchain technology and virtual worlds to provide a more secure, efficient, and accessible banking experience. In this section, we will explore the benefits and challenges of metaverse banking.\n\nBenefits of Metaverse Banking\n\nSecurity: One of the key benefits of metaverse banking is enhanced security. The decentralized nature of blockchain technology means that data is stored across a network of computers, making it more resistant to hacking and cyberattacks. Additionally, transactions on the blockchain are cryptographically secured, making it virtually impossible for fraudsters to manipulate or alter transaction data.\n\nPrivacy: Metaverse banking also offers improved privacy. Traditional banks collect a lot of personal information from customers, including their social security numbers, home addresses, and financial information. This information can be vulnerable to breaches and theft. In contrast, metaverse banking uses pseudonyms and encrypted identifiers to protect user privacy.\n\nLower Fees: Another advantage of metaverse banking is lower fees. Traditional banks charge customers fees for various services, such as ATM withdrawals, wire transfers, and monthly account maintenance. In contrast, metaverse banking operates on a peer-to-peer network that eliminates intermediaries and reduces transaction fees.\n\nFaster Transactions: Metaverse banking also enables faster transactions. In traditional banking, international wire transfers can take days to clear due to the involvement of intermediaries and regulatory requirements. In contrast, metaverse banking transactions can be completed in minutes or even seconds, regardless of the location of the parties involved.\n\nAccessibility: Metaverse banking offers greater accessibility to financial services. Traditional banking requires customers to visit a physical branch during business hours. This can be a significant barrier for individuals who live in rural areas or have mobility issues. In contrast, metaverse banking is accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, making it easier for individuals to access financial services.\n\nFaster Settlements: Metaverse banking also offers faster settlements. In traditional banking, it can take several days for funds to be transferred from one account to another. In contrast, metaverse banking enables real-time settlements, allowing users to receive funds instantly.\n\nIncreased Transparency: Metaverse banking offers increased transparency. Blockchain technology enables users to track transactions in real-time, making it easier to identify fraudulent activity and maintain a transparent record of financial transactions.\n\nInstant Payments: Metaverse banking enables instant payments. With traditional banking, transactions can be held up by intermediaries, causing delays in payment processing. In contrast, metaverse banking enables instant payments, reducing delays and improving the overall efficiency of the payment process.\n\nBetter Customer Service: Metaverse banking offers better customer service. Traditional banking can be slow and cumbersome, with customers often waiting on hold for extended periods to speak with a representative. In contrast, metaverse banking offers immediate customer support, with users able to access customer service through chatbots or virtual assistants.\n\nReduced Risk: Metaverse banking offers reduced risk. Traditional banking is vulnerable to security breaches and fraud, which can result in significant losses for both banks and customers. In contrast, metaverse banking offers enhanced security features that reduce the risk of fraudulent activity.\n\nImproved Access to Capital: Metaverse banking offers improved access to capital. Traditional banking requires customers to go through a lengthy and often complicated loan application process. In contrast, metaverse banking offers peer-to-peer lending platforms that enable users to lend and borrow funds without the need for intermediaries.\n\nAutomated Everything: Metaverse banking offers automated everything. Traditional banking requires manual processing of transactions, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. In contrast, metaverse banking relies on smart contracts and automated processes, reducing the potential for human error and streamlining the entire banking process.\n\nGlobal Reach: Metaverse banking has a global reach",

    "prompt": "I'll give you the scenario and can you help me what to do. \nI've investment in microfinance companies in Nepal. This is the business model: Microfinance in Nepal borrows funds from Commercial banks and they also collects deposits from members. Deposit collected from member is a low cost whereas the funds borrowed from banks is high cost. In the same time, they can't lend to the lenders taking more than 15%, that means their maximum lending rate is capped at 15%. Now, as the interest rates for commercial banks has started to risen recently and already their base rate has exceeded 10%, they can only provide loans to microfinance by adding 2%. i.e, microfinance cost of fund would be at least 12%, and some of them have already exceeded 15%. \nOh, I forget to mention other thing as well, due to the recent rise in interest rate, the borrowers from microfiannce companies are not being able to pay back their loans, so the non performing loans has been rising recently. \nIn this case, should I exit my investments from entire sector or being contrarian, should I buy more companies ? Please give me with the reasons and please explain me the scenario in terms of investment right now.",
    "answer": "It is not possible to make a specific recommendation on your investment without a full understanding of your financial situation, investment goals, and risk tolerance. However, I can provide you with some general information and guidance to help you make an informed decision.\n\nBased on the scenario you've described, the microfinance sector in Nepal appears to be facing some challenges. The rising interest rates are making it more expensive for microfinance companies to borrow funds, and the increase in non-performing loans suggests that the borrowers are having difficulty repaying their loans.\n\nIn such a situation, being a contrarian and investing in more microfinance companies could be a high-risk strategy. On the other hand, exiting your investments from the entire sector might also not be the best decision, as the sector could still recover if the interest rates decline or if the microfinance companies are able to find ways to mitigate the impact of rising interest rates.\n\nIt would be wise to consult a financial advisor and consider the current market conditions, the financial performance of the specific microfinance companies in which you've invested, and your overall investment portfolio before making any decisions.",

Write in the style of a lengthy and descriptive story including deep dialogue.",
    "answer": "It had been a long time since the crew of Deep Space 9 had been able to enjoy a proper vacation, and as they sat sipping drinks on the beaches of Risa, it was clear that they were making the most of it. Julian Bashir, Jadzia Dax, Worf, Kira Nerys, and Odo had all come along for the trip, eager to leave the stresses of their duties on the station behind.\n\nJulian, however, couldn't help but feel a little left out. His friends were all paired off, Jadzia with Worf and Kira with Odo, and he couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy as he watched them all cuddled up together on the sand. He knew he shouldn't feel this way - after all, he was happy for his friends - but he couldn't help the way he felt.\n\nAs he sat alone, nursing a drink and staring out at the water, he noticed a commotion a little ways down the beach. A young man was being harassed by a handsy alien, and from the look on his face, it was clear he was extremely uncomfortable. Julian watched for a moment, hesitating, before deciding to intervene.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" he said, striding up to the pair. \"Is there a problem here?\"\n\nThe alien glared at him, but Julian stood his ground, a steely look in his eye. Eventually, the alien backed down, snarling as he slinked away.\n\n\"Thank you,\" the young man said, a relieved smile on his face. \"I was starting to think I was going to have to punch him.\"\n\nJulian laughed. \"I wouldn't have blamed you. Are you alright?\"\n\nThe young man, who introduced himself as K, nodded. \"Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks for stepping in.\"\n\nJulian gestured to the horga'hn K was holding. \"You know, that's a pretty powerful symbol around here. You might want to be careful flashing it around.\"\n\nK looked confused. \"What do you mean? It's just a statue.\"\n\nJulian chuckled. \"Let's just say it's a symbol for... certain activities.\"\n\nK's face turned bright red as he realized what Julian was insinuating. \"Oh, I had no idea. I'm so sorry.\"\n\nJulian grinned. \"No need to apologize. It's actually kind of cute how clueless you are.\"\n\nK looked up at him, eyes wide. \"Cute?\"\n\nJulian felt a flush rise to his cheeks. \"Uh, I mean, in a... non-romantic way, of course.\"\n\nK smiled, and they fell into an easy conversation, chatting about their lives and experiences. As the sun began to set, Julian realized he was having more fun than he had all week.\n\n\"I have to go,\" K said, glancing at the sky. \"My friends are probably wondering where I am.\"\n\nJulian nodded, feeling a pang of disappointment. \"It was nice meeting you.\"\n\nK hesitated for a moment, then leaned in and pressed a soft kiss to Julian's cheek. \"Thank you again for helping me. Maybe I'll see you around?\"\n\nJulian watched as K walked away, feeling a flutter in his chest. Maybe this vacation wasn't such a bust after all.",

By doing this, you can reduce the impact on the database and avoid locking the table for an extended period.\n\nHere is an example of how you can modify the query to use an index and delete records in batches:\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX idx_xmls_summary_info_detailed ON patent_store.xmls_summary_info_detailed (p_cc, p_date, p_ki, system, file_loc);\n\nDO\n$$\nDECLARE\n  batch_size INTEGER := 10000;\n  offset INTEGER := 0;\n  num_deleted INTEGER := 0;\nBEGIN\n  LOOP\n    DELETE FROM patent_store.xmls_summary_info_detailed s\n    USING (\n      SELECT MAX(CTID) AS max_ctid, p_cc, p_date, p_ki, system, file_loc\n      FROM patent_store.xmls_summary_info_detailed\n      WHERE p_cc = 'CN'\n        AND p_date >= '2002-04-28'\n        AND p_date <= '2004-10-14'\n        AND system = 'CXMLPLUS'\n        AND insert_dt >= '2023-03-27 21:30:29.762685'\n      GROUP BY p_cc, p_date, p_ki, system, file_loc\n      ORDER BY NULL\n      LIMIT batch_size\n      OFFSET offset\n    ) retain_group\n    WHERE retain_group.max_ctid <> s.ctid\n      AND retain_group.p_cc = s.p_cc\n      AND retain_group.p_date = s.p_date\n      AND retain_group.p_ki = s.p_ki\n      AND retain_group.system = s.system\n      AND retain_group.file_loc = s.file_loc;\n      \n    GET DIAGNOSTICS num_deleted = ROW_COUNT;\n    IF num_deleted = 0 THEN\n      EXIT;\n    END IF;\n    offset := offset + batch_size;\n  END LOOP;\nEND;\n$$\n```\nIn this modified query, we first create an index on the columns used in the WHERE and GROUP BY clauses. We then use a DO block with a DECLARE section to define variables that will be used to delete records in batches. The batch\\_size variable controls the number of records to delete in each iteration, while the offset variable keeps track of the current position in the table. The num\\_deleted variable is used to track the number of records deleted in each iteration.\n\nThe DELETE statement inside the LOOP uses the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses to delete a batch of records at a time. The ORDER BY NULL clause is added to the GROUP BY subquery to improve performance, since we don't need to order the results. The GET DIAGNOSTICS statement is used to retrieve the number of rows affected by the DELETE operation. If no rows are affected, we exit the loop.\n\nBy using an index and deleting records in batches, this modified query can be optimized for large tables with billions of records.",

    "prompt": "As you may know, I have been working in QA for a little over 6 years now, in various fields, such as healthcare, retail, and logistics. Initially, I started off as a manual QA tester and eventually made the transition toward automation. \n As an automation engineer, I have a good understanding of SDLC and STLC. I have performed different UI and backend testing types such as smoke, regression, performance, functional, and integration.\n\nDuring my testing career, I have participated in the development and maintenance of BDD and TDD frameworks utilizing Java, and implementing various automation tools, such as Selenium WebDriver, Maven, TestNG, JUnit, and Cucumber. I also have experience working with GIT, JIRA, MySQL, and Jenkins\n\nI am pretty comfortable with API testing, using Postman, and Rest-Assured libraries, as well as with performance testing, using JMeter. \n\nApart from my technical skills, I am a great team player, and I can perform well in my individual tasks. I always make sure that I meet the deadline for each sprint and do my best to prioritize my tasks and cover the most significant requirements.\nconsidering the intro above, build a framework from scratch for truckerpath.com load board search functionality",
    "answer": "Sure, I can help you build a framework from scratch for the TruckerPath load board search functionality. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Define the project scope and requirements: To build an effective automation framework, you need to understand the requirements of the project. In this case, the project is to test the load board search functionality of TruckerPath. The requirements could include searching for loads based on specific criteria, such as origin, destination, date, and load type.\n2. Choose the programming language and automation tools: Since you have experience with Java, you can choose Java as the programming language for your automation framework. The automation tools that you can use for this project include Selenium WebDriver, Maven, TestNG, JUnit, and Cucumber. You can also use Rest-Assured for API testing and JMeter for performance testing.\n3. Set up the project structure: You can use a Maven project to manage the dependencies and build the project. Set up the project structure by creating the necessary folders and files, such as the pom.xml file, the src/main/java and src/test/java folders, and the testng.xml file.\n4. Implement the UI automation tests: To test the load board search functionality, you can create UI automation tests using Selenium WebDriver and TestNG. Create a separate Java class for each test case and use TestNG annotations to define the test steps. For example:\n```less\npublic class LoadBoardSearchTests {\n    private WebDriver driver;\n\n    @BeforeClass\n    public void setUp() {\n        // Initialize the driver\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    public void searchForLoadsByOrigin() {\n        // Navigate to the load board page\n        // Enter the origin city and state\n        // Click the search button\n        // Verify that the search results contain loads with the specified origin\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    public void searchForLoadsByDestination() {\n        // Navigate to the load board page\n        // Enter the destination city and state\n        // Click the search button\n        // Verify that the search results contain loads with the specified destination\n    }\n\n    @AfterClass\n    public void tearDown() {\n        // Quit the driver\n    }\n}\n```\nYou can use the Page Object Model design pattern to make the UI automation tests more maintainable and readable.\n5. Implement the API automation tests: To test the API functionality, you can create API automation tests using Rest-Assured and JUnit. Create a separate Java class for each test case and use JUnit annotations to define the test steps. For example:\n```less\npublic class LoadBoardApiTests {\n    @Test\n    public void searchForLoadsByOrigin() {\n        // Send a GET request to the load board API with the origin parameter\n        // Verify that the response contains loads with the specified origin\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    public void searchForLoadsByDestination() {\n        // Send a GET request to the load board API with the destination parameter\n        // Verify that the response contains loads with the specified destination\n    }\n}\n```\n6. Implement the BDD features and scenarios: To make the tests more readable and maintainable, you can use Cucumber to implement the BDD features and scenarios. Create a separate .feature file for each feature and define the scenarios using Gherkin syntax. For example:\n```vbnet\nFeature: Load Board Search\n\n  Scenario: Search for loads by origin\n    Given I am on the load board page\n    When I enter the origin city and state\n    And I click the search button\n    Then I should see loads with the specified origin\n\n  Scenario: Search for loads by destination\n    Given I am on the load board page\n    When I enter\n```",

Instead of an app, a way to test this could be YouTube ads to people in early 20s living in Minneapolis that say if they wanna meet people they can give phone number / email or sign up on a link where they give a bit of info on themselves / interests / photo / contact info (can be a google form that goes to a google sheets database. Then, we charge people say $50-100 for access to the info on people that wanna meet people. So flow is: ad, landing page with free version (so they don\u2019t get to fill form till paying for full version and can understand how / why etc it works, we can say we make ppl pay so you don\u2019t waste time with people who aren\u2019t serious/ responsive), then they can click link to pay, payment screen, then link to full version. All the work is on other people to reach out, which is good cause then it feels more natural.

    "prompt": "Good! You seem to have a good understanding of this function. So, the thing I need to do, is to modify this code to run a \"sliding window\" over the input. Let me explain a bit better. There is an n\\_past parameter, which is called with increasingly large values the more tokens are fed to the input. At one point, n\\_past becomes larger than this transformer's context window (which is 2048 tokens) and then I can't generate any more input.\n\nThere's this memory\\_k and memory\\_v tensors, and my rationale here was that simply by shifting the contents of the tensors in-memory (they seems to store information in layers, so I am shifting the memory for every layer) I would be able to drop the first token in the sequence, and make run so that I'm able to run inference with one more token.\n\nThe problem here is that the moment I this, the output from the transformer becomes completely broken. And I was wondering if I have some fundamental misconception about this.\n\nSomeone told me this may be due to positional encoding, but the contents of the memory\\_k and memory\\_v tensors don't seem to be positionally encoded, so I'm not sure if that's an issue",
    "answer": "Your idea of using a sliding window approach to handle longer input sequences seems reasonable. However, you might indeed face issues with positional encoding when using this approach.\n\nIn transformers, positional encoding is added to the token embeddings before they are passed through the layers. This means that even though the memory\\_k and memory\\_v tensors might not have positional encodings directly applied to them, the key and value matrices generated from the token embeddings (which contain positional encoding) have implicitly encoded positional information.\n\nWhen you slide the window and shift the contents of the memory\\_k and memory\\_v tensors, you are essentially changing the relative positions of the tokens, but the positional information from the original encoding is still present. This misalignment between the actual positions of the tokens and their encoded positions could lead to unexpected results in the transformer's output.\n\nTo address this issue, you could try the following:\n\n1. When you shift the memory\\_k and memory\\_v tensors, also update the positional encoding for the remaining tokens in the input sequence. You will need to adjust the code to expose and update the positional encoding values accordingly.\n2. Alternatively, you can use a method that can handle long sequences without relying on a sliding window. One such method is the Longformer architecture, which uses a combination of local and global self-attention mechanisms to efficiently process long sequences.\n\nRemember that implementing a sliding window approach might require more modifications than just shifting the memory\\_k and memory\\_v tensors. You will also need to ensure that you handle other parts of the code (e.g., masks and other tensors) correctly to account for the changes in the input sequence.",

    "prompt": "The animals (cat, snake, frog): \u201cWaiting for something to happen?\u201d: this question hints at an underlying countertendency to Sunny\u2019s current, static and undeveloping condition. It suggests the need for Sunny to take action himself in order to overcome his predicament, and hints at the fact that nothing will ever happen which will amend his repressed actions and his current condition unless he initiates it; it is implicitly condemning his current coping mechanism. \nIt also has a sinister ring to it. \u201cWaiting for something to happen?\u201d, can also be interpreted as hinting at suicide depending on what action Sunny takes. This is especially the case given that Mewo says this in white space where Omori has to stab himself to progress, as well as the butler in the Mewo room. On another note, the question also is directed towards the player in the moment as they wonder what to do. \n\u2022 Jung: the appearance of lower animals in dreams often has them represent a part of the unconscious as the unconscious is \u2018archaic\u2019 in the same way that the animal psyche is archaic (possibly relevant?)\n\nThe above is an interpretation of the meaning of the animals which appear in Headspace and what they say. Do you have any comments?",
    "answer": "The interpretation of the animals in Omori as symbols of the unconscious is consistent with Jungian psychology, as Jung believed that animals in dreams often represented aspects of the dreamer's own psyche. The idea that the animals represent a call to action and the need for Sunny to take control of his life is also a common theme in Jungian psychology, which emphasizes the importance of individual responsibility and self-realization.\n\nThe suggestion that the animals' question \"Waiting for something to happen?\" has a sinister ring to it and may be interpreted as a hint at suicide is a valid interpretation, given the themes of depression and suicide in the game. However, it's also worth noting that the question can be interpreted in a more general sense as a call to action and a reminder that change will not happen unless Sunny takes initiative.\n\nOverall, the interpretation of the animals in Omori seems to be consistent with both Jungian psychology and the themes of the game. The animals serve as a reminder that the key to overcoming depression and achieving wholeness lies within the individual's own psyche, and that taking action and responsibility for one's own life is crucial for personal growth and self-realization.",

This historic vessel is believed to have been built around 890 AD and is considered to be one of the largest and best-preserved Viking ships ever found.\n\nThe Gokstad Ship was originally used as a burial ship for a Viking chieftain, and was found with numerous artifacts, including weapons, tools, and clothing. These items provided valuable insight into the lives and customs of the Vikings during this time period.\n\nThe ship itself is approximately 23 meters (75 feet) in length and 5 meters (16 feet) in width, with a shallow draft that would have allowed it to navigate through shallow waters and up rivers. It was constructed primarily of oak planks, with a single mast and a square sail that would have allowed it to travel long distances at a relatively fast pace.\n\nOne of the most notable features of the Gokstad Ship is its construction, which demonstrates the skilled craftsmanship of the Viking shipbuilders. The planks were carefully fitted together and secured with iron nails, while the keel was made of two large oak beams that were carefully shaped and fitted together to create a strong and stable foundation for the ship.",

The atmosphere is somber and reflective, as if the ship is a reminder of a long-forgotten era.\n\n/imagine prompt: [1], Photography (Wide Angle): The Gokstad Ship is captured in a wide-angle shot that showcases its impressive size and the surrounding landscape.
